**Course Overview**
Historical cryptography was an arms race between the ingenuity of the "good guys" in designing ciphers and the "bad guys" in breaking them. Modern cryptography, however, allows us to mathematically prove statements about security. A major theme in this course is to understand to talk about security in such a rigorous way. In this course you should expect to learn how to:
* State and interpret the standard formal definitions for the most common cryptographic security properties (privacy and authentication)
* Formally prove security properties of sound cryptographic constructions, and break the security of unsound ones. 
* Choose the appropriate cryptographic primitive for a task (block ciphers, hash functions, MACs, public-key encryption, etc.) while avoiding common pitfalls. 
Along the way, you will also learn how the most common cryptographic constructions work.
