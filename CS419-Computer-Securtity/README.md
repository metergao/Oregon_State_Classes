CS 419 Intro to Computer Security
====================
**Course Objectives**
This is an introductory course on computer security. It introduces some major topics in computer and communication security and information assurance. The objective of this course is to provide students with a basic understanding of the problems of information assurance and some of the solutions that exist to secure information on computers.

Due to time limitations this course does not delve into cryptographic primitives and network security. Students interested in computer security are encouraged to take Cryptography and Network Security courses offered in Winter and Spring quarters respectively to further their knowledge in this area.
