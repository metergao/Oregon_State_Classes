\section{Introduction}
\indent For my second MECOP internship I was fortunate to be placed at Precision Castpart Corp.. This 
was my second time being immersed into a professional atmosphere in the field that 
I am studying and I enjoyed it equally as much as the first. I am a computer science student with a focus 
on security and I thought that Precision Castparts Corp. was more of an "old school" 
non-tech company before my internship. I was greatly mistaken. Precision Castparts Corp. has a lot of advanced 
technology and very intricate security. It was 
beneficial for me to learn the basics of how a large corporation like Precision Castpart Corp. 
handles security. I now feel more well rounded and have at least some experience relating to
my security focus.

\section{Precision Castparts Corp.}

\subsection{What does Precision Castpart Corp. do?}
\indent When I was first placed at Precision Castpart Corp. I had not heard much about them. I 
was not aware that they were one of Oregon's two fortune 500 companies.
Precision Castparts Corporation specializes in the casting of metal aerospace parts. 
They are the world leader in investment casting, forged components, and airfoil castings. 
The company was started over 60 years ago in Portland, OR by Joseph Cox, the owner of 
Oregon Saw Chain. The initial intention was to cast a special cutter for his chain saw 
products. The company began focusing their time on developing the casting operations 
and looking for more outside work. This portion of the company became so successful that 
it branched out and became a separate business called Precision Castparts Co. The company 
began pushing to create larger castings and, by 1962, was able to pour a casting weighing 
1,000 pounds. PCC soared above all of the competition, and later signed contracts with 
General Electric, Boeing, Pratt \& Whitney, and several other aerospace companies. The company 
began developing their processes with titanium, nickel, and stainless steel alloys. PCC soon
became the world leader of manufacturing large titanium castings as well. The company currently 
has several campuses throughout Portland, and has recently been acquired by Warren 
Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway.

\subsection{MIS}
\indent During my internship at Precision Castparts Corp I was exposed to many 
different departments. The casting process has not changed much over the 60 years 
Precision Castparts Corp has been around, but what has changed a lot has been the 
technology that they have been using to refine the casting process and this is where 
the MIS department comes in. All of the technology is managed by the MIS 
(Management Information System) department. For a large 
portion of my internship I was stationed at the helpdesk. I liked the atmosphere 
of the helpdesk and the opportunity to get hands on experience with technology all
around the plant. I would help individual users with minor problems like email 
to large issues that were halting production like robotic arms. 

\subsection{Mentor/Supervisors}
\indent My mentors were the managers of the MIS department Steve Jessie and Dave 
Rajkumar. Both Steve and 
Dave were responsible for keeping all of Precision Castparts Corp technology up 
to date and secure. Management encompassed the LAN Admins, Programmers, 
Helpdesk, and the Telecom employees. I was often at my desk in the 
helpdesk which was separate from the MIS department we kept a close relationship 
with the other programmers, LAN admins, and techs. I worked with a lot of individuals 
during my time at Precision Castpart Corp. often times when a problem would arise 
we would all have a role in getting the issue resolved. 

\section{Projects}

\subsection{Aras Innovator Upgrade}
\indent The first large project that I had the opportunity to work on was upgrading 
Aras Innovator. The drive for the MIS department to upgrade Innovator was that the 
current version when I began at PCC only worked on Internet Explorer 9. We wanted 
to move all of our computers to Internet Explorer 11 and to do this we had to make 
sure that Innovator would continue to work. Innovator is a unique process control 
visualization tool that is used company wide and a seamless upgrade with no errors
was required. I worked very closely with Kyle Grotjohn who was the lead in the 
upgrade. We both had to create a comprehensive test plan that would get as close 
to 100\% coverage as possible. This plan was huge, if there was a check box that 
could be clicked there was a whole test just to test that one check box. I spent 
about 4 weeks going through the test plan and creating bug reports for any errors 
I came across. The bug report contained screenshots, the steps taken to reproduce 
the error, and my description of the what was supposed to happen. Aras corp were 
actually the ones in charge of fixing the bugs, so I would package all of my 
reports up and send it to them. 
\\
\indent This was the first time I have been introduced to the Aras Innovator Application. 
Since Kyle had begun to test this tool before me, he was a great mentor on the application. 
It was really nice to have some tests in place before I started, and to view how a professional
laid out the base of the test plan. Mimicking the style helped me create and execute 
a well designed test plan.
\\
\indent One of the biggest takeaways from this project was the importance of clear 
and easy to read documentation. In my past projects that I developed tests, I 
never created a test plan which probably resulted in many functions not getting coverage.
Studying the test plan before beginning my work on this project, I noticed that 
there were clear comments everywhere. Since I mimicked Kyle's testing style, I too 
used an abundance of comments. I soon came to the realization how much easier 
it is to understand and take care of bugs when you know where they come from. \\


\textbf{Things Learned:}
\begin{itemize} 
        \item .Net framework
        \item Internet Explorer compatibility
        \item Creating Bug reports
        \item Work with others following a plan
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Security Audit}
\indent Many of the contracts that Precision Castparts Corp. has, cyber security has to be top 
notch. Precision Castparts Corp. would conduct bimonthly security audits that would check every computer 
that is in our domain. We would get separate lists of computers that had reported 
missing mandatory security software. Each list would have the computers that would require us to manually connect to each machine and 
verify that the computer either reported a false-positive or was indeed missing 
the software. I saw this as a great opportunity to implement automation. I began 
creating scripts that would make the audit process quicker and more accurate. The 
first Script that I wrote would take all the computer names and try to gather more 
info on them. The script would ping each computer to see if they are currently 
online, get the last user who logged into the workstation, and the last time time 
the computer was logged in. 
\\
\indent
At first the other PC techs were skeptical of using my scripts since they had been 
doing the security audits many times in the past and did not want to cause more 
problems. After a while they began to see the usefulness in what the scripts accomplished. 
Each script needed to increase the productivity of the audit process. I spent time 
developing the scripts which put me behind schedule on the first audit but the 
audits that came after the scripts increase my productivity tremendously.
\\
\indent Before the first security audit I had not used Powershell to create scripts.
It was a slight learning curve that I had to overcome. I am very familiar with the 
Unix shell environment and Powershell shared many of the same characteristics. One 
challenge that I had to overcome was that Windows would not actually run any Powershell 
script that had not been signed. This was a problem since I did not have access to 
a Windows development key for signing, I ended up creating a wrapper Batch script 
that would enable unsigned execution and then, after executing, set the execution 
policy back to the default. Needless to say writing the batch script wrapper was more 
difficult than the Powershell script. The Batch script syntax was very different 
from the familiar Unix shell environment. 

\textbf{Things Learned:}
\begin{itemize} 
        \item Powershell scripts
        \item SCCM reporting
        \item Active Directory
        \item Windows CLI
    \end{itemize}

\section{Minor Projects}

\subsection{PC Builds}
\indent One of the main tasks that the PC technicians at the helpdesk were responsible 
for were building computers for the employees. The first step in building a PC was 
to either construct a computer for previously deployed machines or taking one out 
of stock. My previous experience of building my own computers helped a lot in this 
task. Once we had a working computer we would have to image it with a working OS.
With all of the standard applications that need to be installed on each machine, it would 
take a long time to get each computer installed with the required applications. 
SCCM actually allows you to build a PC with a set of Applications preinstalled. 
I never knew this was a feature of SCCM and it made the build process much faster 
and easier.\\
\indent After the SCCM image was complete the computer still needed some manual tech 
work. Each computer must be fully encrypted. All the PC we would build have 
an on-board hardware encryption module called TPM (Trusted Platform Module). With 
my security interest I enjoyed learning how to enable the TPM and preform a full 
disk encryption. \\
\textbf{Things Learned:}
    \begin{itemize} 
        \item Determining hardware requirements
        \item SCCM Network Images
        \item TPM Encryption 
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Application Installs}
\indent Many of the Precision Castparts Corp. employees needed specialized non-standard 
applications. A lot of the applications that I had to install were in-house applications
that had very vague and abnormal installation procedures. I became very familiar 
with asking other techs and sometimes the developers how to install the requested 
application. I enjoyed the learning curve that was required to install some of the applications. 
It was rewarding knowing the very unique installation procedure the second time 
around and giving advice to the new techs on how to install the application. 

\indent Before working at the helpdesk I never had to provide remote assistance 
to anyone. It was pretty weird remoting into peoples computers even when 
I was on the phone with them. I felt like I was invading their privacy. After I became 
more familiar with remote assistance etiquette I no longer felt this way.\\ 

\textbf{Things Learned:}
\begin{itemize} 
        \item Asking developers for install instructions
        \item Remote Control assistance
        \item Analyzing install time
    \end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
\subsection{What I learned}
\indent During my 6 month internship I learned a comparable amount of degree related knowledge
to what I would have at school. The main difference was that the things I learned while 
Working at Precision Castparts Corp. no class could teach. One of my most exciting things 
I learned during my internship is how to be efficient. I consider myself 100\% more 
comfortable in a Windows environment. I believe that I will be a much more well rounded programmer 
and will be able to produce a higher quality of work from the tips and tricks 
that I learned during my time at Precision Castparts Corp. The real world work environment seems 
far less scary to me now that I have had a slight taste of it. It was very neat 
to see how my background knowledge from school got integrated into the work place.
I would often times recall information from previous classes that would help me 
solve problems I faced during my internship. 
\\
\subsection{How the internship benefited me}
\indent This internship has benefited me in many ways. One of the best 
benefits I will takeaway from this internship is knowing that I can work in the 
industry. It was enlightening to see that I was working on real projects alongside full time 
employees were working on and finding solutions to real time problems. I liked working on 
nonstandard problems in contrast to school where I was finishing 
a homework assignment that I knew every other CS student had solved before me.  
\\
\subsection{How I benefited Precision Castparts Corp.}
\indent I didn't realize how important my contributions were to Precision 
Castparts Corp. until Kyle one of my coworkers wrote a recommendation on my Linkedin 
profile saying "I worked with Sam on the Aras Innovator System upgrade from version 
9 SP3 to 11 SP2. Sam was invaluable as a testing resource throughout the entire 
upgrade, have it be following test plans and bringing up issues or writing some 
test plans himself that followed user procedure more closely. The learning curve 
to the Aras UI is only trumped by the high level of customizability within the 
solution and with all of those hurdles Sam still continued with a positive demeanor 
and continued to exceed my expectations. His ability to understand and learn business 
practices, customized programmatic solution, and following/creating test plans were 
invaluable to me throughout the entire upgrade process. I am confident that Sam 
possesses the determination and learning capability to succeed wherever his career 
takes him.". After I heard this I truly felt that Precision Castparts Corp. valued my work 
and that I was actually making a difference.\\
