CS 311
====================
This course is intended as an introduction to the functionality provided by a multiprogrammed operating system. This includes the use of the shell, common tools, process and thread control, and interprocess communiction -- shared memory, message queues, pipes, and sockets. The specific operating system used wiill be Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Topics covered will include:
	Regular expressions

	The python programming language, as a tool of both shell scripting and multilanguage programming

	The POSIX/SUS system call API

	Threading

	IPC - shared memory, pipes, sockets

	File system manipulation

It is assumed that a basic C knowledge is had by all students in the class. This includes syntax, flow control constructs, basic function usage, and pointers. Basic UNIX/Linux knowledge is also assumed. Only general refreshers will be provided. Please see resources page for helpful information if you feel lacking in these areas.

You will be allowed to use your choice of editor: either vi(m) or emacs. I strongly suggest you avoid editors such as pico or nano, as they are not development oriented editors. Personally, I am an emacs user, and have provided a basic .emacs file on the resources page. You will absolutely be unable to use Visual Studio for this class without extensive work on your part. You will have trouble using any IDE for this class, but you are certainly welcome to do so. All examples will be shown in emacs, and I offer no support for any other editor.
