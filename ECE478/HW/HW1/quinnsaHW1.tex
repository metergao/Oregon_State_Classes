\section{Question about basic concepts:}
\noindent \textbf{What are the main security/performance trade-offs for symmetric and asymmetric cryptography to be deployed in practice? Could you give real-life scenarios where symmetric and asymmetric crypto could be more suitable?}

Symmetric and asymmetric cryptography are the two basic forms of encryption with each functioning differently than one another. Symmetric cryptography is faster but needs the secret key share between all parties before hand. Since there is one secret key that is shared between all parties before hand it all encryption as well as decryption is done with the same key, meaning that all parties use the same key. Symmetric is better when dealing with only trusted parties since you cannot
establish authentication with only one secret key. Symmetric encryption is ideal for encrypting personal files where the secret key would not need to be shared.\\
\indent Asymmetric cryptography dose not need the secret key to be shared before hand. Asymmetric encryption needs two keys, a private key and a public key. The public key may be shared with the presence of an eavesdropper with no security penalties. Asymmetric encryption keys do not need to be pre-shared with parties, and since every party has their own key pair it will also provide authentication. Asymmetric cryptography is ideal for applications where both parties have never spoken before, for example SSH. 

\noindent \textbf{OTPs are highly secure, but why we do not see them much in practice?}


One time pad is one of the highest security since each bit of the plaintext is randomized, the random pattern used to in the OTP can only be used once or information can be extracted form the cipher text. The main problem with OTP is that the size of the key must be the size of the data, and a new key must be generated every message. 

\noindent \textbf{Does Kerckhoffs's principle contradict with the ``secret algorithm'' practice in military systems? Given sufficient financial capability, how could you incorporate Kerckhoffs's principle into such high-end systems?}

The security systems used in the military are often classified until they come up with a new method in which the old systems are released to the public. Withholding the current system from the public introduces the property of security through obscurity since the adversary does not know the algorithms used. One way to introduce Kerckhoffs's principle in to military systems would be to hire a team of skilled cryptographers to study the security systems used thus giving them complete knowledge
of the system minus the key. If the team are able to break the system then the only thing that is keeping the military security system secure is the obscurity which is very weak. However if the team is unable to break the system knowing everything but the key then the system is secure plus the added bonus of being obscure.

\section{Data Encryption Standard (DES). DES has weak keys.}
\noindent \textbf{What is the difference between a weak key, a semi-weak key and a possible weak key?}

The origin of weak, semi-weak, and possibly weak keys in DES start with how DES extracts each rounds encryption keys from the master 56bit key. The 56bit key is divided into 16 sub keys one for each cycle of the DES encryption. A weak key would be $\lbrace0\rbrace^{56}$ or $\lbrace1\rbrace^{56}$ where all of the bits are the same thus making the rotating of the keys for each cycle useless. A semi-weak key would be a key that would reverse the cycle that took place in the previous cycle. A
key that repeats with a period of 2 meaning that the rotation of keys produces exactly two keys that will be each be used 8 times. Possibly weak keys are keys that repeat with a period of 4, outputting 4 unique keys that will all be used 4 times each. (http://search.proquest.com/openview/6cc5dfe1f7c352582f2b62aa741b47dd/1?pq-origsite=gscholar) 

\noindent \textbf{What is double DES?  What kind of attack on double DES makes it useless?}

Double DES does two rounds of DES encryption with two different keys, thus making the key 112 bits long. With a meet in the middle attack the added benefit of encrypting twice does not increase the security much. 
Meet in the middle attack. The effective security gain from the single DES $2^{56}$ is increased by one exponential to $2^{57}$ in double DES. Double DES is useless because an adversary could brute force the first round (single DES) and then just pass the output to the second round without the need for any brute forcing. (http://stephanemoore.com/pdf/meetinthemiddle.pdf)

\noindent \textbf{What is triple DES?  How many keys are use in triple DES process?}

Triple DES uses three rounds of DES making the maximum security 168 bits. Triple DES can either use 2 or 3 keys, however the effective security due to the meet in the middle attack explained above is $2^{112}$ for both. This is because if 2 of the 3 rounds are extract the adversary will be able to perform the meet in the middle attack on the first two and a normal brute force on the remaining round. \\
\begin{center}
    $2^{56} + 2^{112} \approx 2^{112}$
\end{center}


\section{Block Cipher Design Principles and AES}
\noindent \textbf{What is the basic design  technique,  which  is  frequently  used  to  construct  modern symmetric ciphers?}

Symmetric cryptography will use techniques to obscure the data with confusion and diffusion. Confusion is mainly accomplished by substitutions, replacing original data with new data. Diffusion is mainly accomplished by permutations, where one bit changes will permute on to all the ciphertext data to further scramble the original input. Modern symmetric ciphers will alternate substitutions and permutations.

\noindent \textbf{What are the main security properties achieved via this designed technique?}

Confusion in a symmetric cipher will help prevent attacks linear attacks. Because the data is passed through a non-linear table often created by the secret key the data is translated in a non-linear way.\\
\indent Diffusion will help prevent against pattern analysis attacks. Since every language has traceable patterns in grammar, diffusion makes these patterns much harder to spot. If one bit is changed the entire ciphertext will be changed not just the corresponding bit within the ciphertext. 

\noindent \textbf{Given the  example  of  AES,  which  functional  steps  enable achieving  these  properties?  Please provide  specific  names  of  these operations  and  briefly  explain  how  they  are  applied  in AES (all answers are brief for this question)?}

\noindent$\bullet$ Confusion: S-Box - Rijndael S-Box is a lookup matrix generated by determining the multiplicative inverse of each byte from the original input. \\
$\bullet$ Diffusion: MixColumn - AES uses a MixColumn function on the Rijndael matrix that permutes any change with data through the use of XORs. 

\noindent \textbf{What are the benefits of the use of finite field arithmetic in AES?}

Finite field arithmetic in AES is a redefinition of how to perform algebraic operations including multiplication, addition, subtraction, and division. A finite field has a finite number of integers that  help prevent adversary against linear attacks. The prevention against linear attacks is achieved based on the fact that the linear arithmetic is abstracted to a point where there needs to be more computation before hand to unscramble the equations.  

\section{Symmetric Encryption Modes}
\noindent \textbf{We have discussed various Symmetric Encryption Modes. Each of  these modes  satisfies certain properties, which can be  an  advantage or disadvantage  for  a given  application. Construct a  table providing a  summary  information  about  each mode and  its corresponding properties. For example,  each  row  of  the  table  will  be  properties  (e.g.,  parallel  operation,  ciphertext manipulation,  pre-computation,  etc.,  please  see  course  notes  for  more  properties)  and  columns are  Modes  (e.g.,  CBC,  CTR…).  Each  cell  will  take  a  value  such  as  “Yes”,  “No”,  “partially”, “high”, “low” etc. according to given encryption mode and property.}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
    \hline
    & \textbf{ECB} & \textbf{CBC} & \textbf{OFB} & \textbf{CFB} & \textbf{CTR} \\ \hline
    \textbf{Parallel} & Yes & Decryption only & No & Decryption only & Yes \\ \hline
    \textbf{Leakage} & Yes & No & No & No & No \\ \hline

    \textbf{Error Propagation} & No & Yes & No & Yes & No \\ \hline
    \textbf{Pre-computation} & No & No & Yes & No & Yes \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\section{Ciphertext  manipulability}
\noindent \textbf{“Ciphertext  manipulability”  is  generally  considered  as  an  undesirable  property  for Encryption  Modes.  However,  for  modes  that  operates  in  stream  cipher  fashion  (discussed  in class), by design, it is possible to flip bits in plaintext by flipping bits of ciphertext. Why is this possible?}

These maniplations are possible based on the fundemental mathmatics behind manipuable encryption algorithims. For RSA it is the fact that $C_{1} \ast C_{2} = X_{1}^{e}X_{2}^{e}mod(M)$, for ElGamal it is because of the cyclic group that the ciphertext will fall into. 

\noindent \textbf{Is  there  a  way  to  turn  this  (potentially)  undesirable  property  into  an  advantage, describe how if there is one?}

Yes, when an encryption scheme has this property of allowing the ciphertext to effect the plaintext in a positive way it is called homomorphic. Elgamal is multiplicatively homomorphic, meaning you can perform multiplication operations on the ciphertext themselves that when decrypted will result in the same multiplication on the plaintext. So if we were given an unknow cyphertext $M \in G$ we can construct a different ciphertext that also decrypts to the same $M$. To get only the original
$M$ out in plaintext we can create a ciphertext $c'$ with a random message $M'$. We can multiply the ciphertexts $c$ and
$c'$ together to get $c*c'$. We can send $c*c'$ to a decryption oracle that will output the message $M*M'$, which all we would have to do is pull out the $M'$ from the resulting plaintext. After we extract the message $M'$ the original message $M$ will be left over. 

For good this property could be used to scale encrypted images stored in the cloud or perform mathmatical opperations over encrypted data without ever knowing the data itself. 

\noindent \textbf{Which  extra  cryptographic  function  (a  group  of  functions  discussed  in  the  class)  can be applied to the ciphertext so that the aforementioned advantage can be obtained without compromising the security?}

\noindent \textit{Hints:  (i) Consider  noisy  communication  channels  as  application  domain  to  exploit  this  feature. 
(ii) The extra cryptographic function will require annexing a small-constant tag to the ciphertext.}

One way to ensure that the ciphertext has not been tampered with before passing it to the decryption oracle is to use an encryption scheme with authentication or encrypt the data then Authenticate E.g. a MAC. This would create a cryptographic checksum that would either be prepended or appended to the encrypted data itself so that the recipient could verify that the data had not been tampered with. 

\section{Encryption and Compression}
\noindent \textbf{Encryption (E) and Compression (C) are generally used together to achieve confidentiality and  efficiency  simultaneously. Given  a message M, with which order  function E  and C must be applied? What are the reasons behind of this particular order?}

Compression must happen before encrypting. This is because compression algorithims usually will take advantage of patterns to minimize the data size, encryption is meant to make the output look random by eliminating patterns. With the encrypted data garbbled most compression algorithims will not have anything to compress. However, if the data is compressed as plaintext the compression algorithims will function at the datas full commpression avalibility which then can be encrypted after. 

\section{Symmetric key Authentication}
\noindent \textbf{In  symmetric  key  cryptography,  it  is  desirable  to  achieve  both  confidentiality  and authentication  (also  provides  integrity)  of  the  data.  These  properties  can  be  achieved  via Encryption (E) and Authentication Functions (A), respectively. What is the correct order of these operations? Lets assume the specific notation and order of these operations are as follows:} 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Authenticate-then-Encrypt (AtE)}
        AtE will provide integirty on the plaintext but the cannot prevent against CPA until the recipient has decrypted the message to retrieve the MAC. In some encryption schemes both the ciphertext, MAC, and plaintext could be manipulated and rencapsulated since the MAC is located within the encryption, provided that the encryption scheme is maluable. 
    \item \textbf{Encrypt-then-Authenticate (EtA)}
        EtA is the most useful order of opperations since it will provide integrity of the ciphertext, which in turn also provides plaintext integrity. EtA will also prevent any CPA since any alterations to the ciphertext will be flagged as invalid. 
    \item \textbf{Encryption and Authentication (E\&A) or the opposite way as (A\&E)}
        E\&A will provide essentially the same benifits of EtA but since the plaintext is authenticated before encryption if the same message is being transmitted the MAC will be the same for every message duplicate message. As for A\&E that is the same thing as E\&A as those functions are happening simultaniously the order does not matter.  
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Discuss the security implications of these choices, which one is recommended and why?}

The reccomend order of opperations would be encrypt then authenticate since will provide integrity of both the ciphertext as well as the plaintext. Since the MAC is taken after the encryption happens it will always produce a uniformly random MAC that would not reviel any information about the encrypted message. 

\noindent \textbf{Mention important crypto papers (at least one, cite it), in which the security of an important real-life  protocol  (Hint:  the  protocol  that  securely  connects  your  VPN  for  each  e-commerce transaction!)  analyzed  based  on  the  above  orders.  Explain  why  this  order  matters  a  lot  in practice?  You  may  provide  some  discussions  from  these  papers  (please  be  brief,  just  hit  on important points).}

In the cryptography paper ``The Order of Enccryption and Authentication for Protecting Communications (or: How Secure Is SSL?)*'' they analyse common network communication method such ass SSL, IPSec, and SSH with regards to how the order of opperations effects the security. \\
SSL: $a = Auth(x), C = Enc(x,a), transmit C$ \\ 
IPSec: $C = Enc(x), a = Auth(C), transmit (C,a)$ \\ 
SSH: $C = Enc(x), a = Auth(x), transmit (C,a)$ \\

EtA is considered secure so form this we can conclude that IPSec is considered secure. However, for SSL the security is questionable even when $Enc()$ is IND-CPA and $Auth()$ provides mussage unforgeability since the packet being transmitted is still supseptible to chosen ciphertext attacks. SSH uses E\&A which is also not proven secure since the MAC while providing unforgability can still leak information about the data being transfered ~\cite{krawczy}.
\section{Cryptographic  hash  functions}
\noindent \textbf{Given  a modern  cryptographic  hash  function  (e.g.,  SHA) with m-bit  length  output, what is  the maximum  security  it  can  provide  in  terms  of  m  (lets  call  it  x-bit  security)? A  generalized proof  for  any  given  m-bit  hash  function  is  available  to  show  why  it  can  achieve  at  best  x-bit security.  Please  describe  this  generalized  proof  (related  birthday  attack  concept)  that  simply connects m-bit to x-bit.}

There must be collisions when there is data larger than the hash output. It realates to the pidgin hole theorem and birthday bounds where as the size of the data continues to incease the amount of potential colloision rise. If a hash funciton returns a hash output size of $m-bits$ then to guarentee you will find a message you will need to hash $2^{m}$ random inputs. If you use the concept of the birthday paradox with at least 0.5 probability you will get a collision where to different
messages have the same hash in $2^{m/2}$ random inputs. 

To calculate the probablity of a collision with in a hash funciton the following formula is given.\\
\indent $Pr[h(m) = h(m')]$ \\
\indent $= 1-Pr[h(x_{1} \neq h_{2}] \ast Pr[h(x_{3} \not\in {h(x_{1},h(x_{2})}] \dots \ast Pr[h(x_(m) \not\in {h(x_{1}), \dots ,h(x_{m-1})}]$ \\
\indent $= 1-(1-\frac{1}{2^{n}})(1-\frac{1}{2^{n}}) \dots (1-\frac{m-1}{2^{n}})$ \\
\indent $\approx 1-e^{-\frac{1}{2^{n}}}e^{\frac{-2}{2^{n}}} \dots e^{\frac{-(m-1)}{2^{n}}}$ \\
In the line above the value of e raised to the negitive it is very close to zero we can't be sure what the absulute value will be so an approximation is need to calculate. \\
\indent $\approx 1-e^{\frac{-m^{2}}{2^{n+1}}}$\\
If we want to find a collision with at least 95\% probability we can plug 95 in to our equation. \\
\indent $0.95 = 1-e^{\frac{-m^{2}}{2^{n+1}}}$\\
\indent $m^{2} = (-ln 0.05)^{2^{n+1}}$ \\
\indent $m \approx 2.45 \ast 2^{\frac{n}{2}} = O(2^{\frac{n}{2}})$ \\

\section{Length extension}
\noindent \textbf{What  is  the  hash  length  extension  attack?  Please  describe  by  giving  some  specific  real-life examples.}

A length extension attack is an attack on HMACs with messages of varining length where an adversary may append new data to the authenticated message with the same signature. 
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics{cbcmac.eps}\\[1cm] % Include a department/university logo - this will require the graphicx package
\end{center}
\indent CBC-MAC is suseptible to a lenghth extention attack when the messages are not restricted to a single length. CBC-MAC will take the input message and compute the CBC encryption of the message. With the idea of a MAC to shorten the input to a fixed size, CBC-MAC will only export the last block of the message into its signature. As described above the output from $e$ will be $\otimes$ by $mx$ until the last block. An adversary is able to attack this MAC if they take the $result$ form
the original MAC $m$ and $\otimes m_{1}'$ with the $result$. This would make the $result$ cancel out the $result \otimes$ that was in $m_{1}'$. After we break the $result$ with $m_{1}'$ we are able to append anything with in $m'$ to the end of $m$ with the same signature.
\begin{center}
    $CBC\_MAC(k,m_{1},..., m_{l}) \rightarrow (m,t)$ \\ $CBC\_MAC(k,m_{1}' \otimes t, ..., m_{l}') \rightarrow (m\|m',t')$
\end{center}
(https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/papers/cbc.pdf)

\section{Properties of cryptographic hash function}
\noindent \textbf{What are the essential properties that a cryptographic hash function must satisfy?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Performance:} Must be easy to compute $H(m)$
    \item \textbf{One-way property:} Given $H(m)$ should not be able to find $m$
    \item \textbf{Weak/Strong Collision Resistance:} $H(m) \neq H(m')$ and $H(m_{1}) \neq H(m_{2})$ if $m_{1} \neq m_{2}$
\end{itemize}
\noindent \textbf{What is a Random Oracle and how does it play a role in the security proofs in general 
(what is its relation with cryptographic hash functions?)}

In security proofs a random oracle is used as a baseline of what the proposed cryptograpihc funciton should be indistingusable against. The random oracle will always produce unifromly random output that has nothing to do with the data passed into the ``blackbox''. When proving an encryption aloritmim or a cryptographic function is secure there should be no way for an adversary to determine if the output came from either the random oracle or the encryption scheme. If an adversary is able
to exploit the cryptographic funciton to a point where they will get deterministic output, then the cryptographic function would not be considered secure. \

Hash functions secutrity can be proven with the use of a random oracle. If an adversary can modify the plaintext input to produce an output that looks anything but unifromly random then the hash function should not be considered secure. The main limitation with a random oracle in regards to cryptographic hash function is that the output is deterministic, meaning that given the same input it should produce the same output. The random oracle can mimic this feature by creating a lookup
table of input and there respective outputs. If a new input comes in the random oracle will return a unifromly random output, but store the output with an association to the input. So if the same input is ever passed in the random oracle will return the same uniformly random string as the first time.
