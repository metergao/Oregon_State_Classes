Refactored 11 parts of the switch statement in cardEffect().

Created these new functions that implement the cards:

int steward_card(int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state, int choice1, int choice2, int choice3, int handPos)
int minion_card(struct gameState *state, int handPos, int currentPlayer, int choice1, int choice2)
int great_hall_card(int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state, int handPos)
int baron_card(struct gameState *state, int choice1, int currentPlayer)
int village_card(int currentPlayer, struct gameState * state, int handPos)
int smithy_card(int currentPlayer, struct gameState * state, int handPos)
int remodel_card(int j, struct gameState *state, int currentPlayer, int choice1, int choice2, int handPos)
int mine_card(int j, struct gameState *state, int currentPlayer, int choice1, int choice2, int handPos)
int feast_card(struct gameState *state, int * temphand, int x, int choice1, int currentPlayer)
int council_card(int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state, int handPos)
int adventure(int drawntreasure, struct gameState *state, int currentPlayer, int cardDrawn, int * temphand, int z)

These are the "errors" I made in the implementation:

Commented drawCard() (line 651) in adventure()
Commented drawCard() (line 672) in council_card()
Commented gainCard() (line 727) in feast_card()
Commented discardCard() (line 777) in mine_card()
