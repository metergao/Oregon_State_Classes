I refactored the following cards:
1) Council Room
2) Remodel
3) Great Hall
4) Salvager
5) Steward

Refactoring, for purposes of this assignment refactoring was taking the code
within the big switch statement and creating a new function called
"cardNameEffect" that replaced the inner code with a function call.
I maintained the semantics of what the code within the switch statement
was doing. If the code within the switch statement was incorrect, it stayed
incorrect, but the code within cardEffect was reduced by creating new function
calls that performed the code. Two cards will still be incorrect.
