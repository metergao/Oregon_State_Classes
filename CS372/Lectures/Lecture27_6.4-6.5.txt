802.11: Channels


802.11b: 2.4GHz-2.485GHz spectrum divided into 11
channels at different frequencies
 AP admin chooses frequency for AP, or they can autohop based on measured interference:
 interference possible: channel can be same as that
chosen by neighboring AP!

802.11: Channels


It is worse to use the non-big three (1, 6, 11), even if
they’re full!
 Collisions happen on BOTH ends, and the result is a lower
transmission rate

802.11: WAP Placement


When placing wireless access points in a building, use a
method that:
 Centralizes the WAPs
 Separates the channels from overlapping (as much as possible)
 Uses the same SSID (network name) and password
 Turn off low data rates if possible
• Some WAPs offer low data rates, which makes devices “stick”
to them as they move around, which prevents devices from
associating with closer, better WAPs
• In some cases, using different SSIDs will help the users to
know which WAP they’re connected to, if stickiness is a
problem

What is mobility?


spectrum of mobility, from the network perspective:

no mobility

mobile wireless user,
using same access
point

high mobility

mobile user,
connecting/
disconnecting from
network using
DHCP.

mobile user, passing
through multiple
access point while
maintaining ongoing
connections (like cell
phone)
Wireless, Mobile Networks 6-15

Mobility: vocabulary
home network: permanent
“home” of mobile
(e.g., 128.119.40/24)

home agent: entity that will
perform mobility functions on
behalf of mobile, when mobile is
remote

wide area
network

permanent address:
address in home
network, can always be
used to reach mobile
e.g., 128.119.40.186

Wireless, Mobile Networks 6-16

Mobility: more vocabulary
permanent address: remains
constant (e.g., 128.119.40.186)

visited network: network in
which mobile currently
resides (e.g., 79.129.13/24)

care-of-address: address
in visited network.
(e.g., 79,129.13.2)

wide area

correspondent: wants
to communicate with
mobile

foreign agent: entity in
visited network that
performs mobility
functions on behalf of
mobile.

How do you contact a mobile friend:
Consider friend frequently changing
addresses, how do you find her?



I wonder where
Alice moved to?

search all phone books?
call her parents?
expect her to let you
know where he/she is?

Wireless, Mobile Networks 6-18

Mobility: approaches




let routing handle it: routers advertise permanent address of
mobile-nodes-in-residence via usual routing table exchange.
 routing tables indicate where each mobile located
 no changes to end-systems
let end-systems handle it:
 indirect routing: communication from correspondent to
mobile goes through home agent, then forwarded to
remote
 direct routing: correspondent gets foreign address of
mobile, sends directly to mobile

Indirect Routing: comments


mobile uses two addresses:
 permanent address: used by correspondent (hence
mobile location is transparent to correspondent)
 care-of-address: used by home agent to forward
datagrams to mobile

foreign agent functions may be done by mobile itself
 triangle routing: correspondent-home-networkmobile


 inefficient when
correspondent, mobile
are in same network
Wireless, Mobile Networks 6-23

Indirect routing: moving between networks
suppose mobile user moves to another network
 registers with new foreign agent
 new foreign agent registers with home agent
 home agent update care-of-address for mobile
 packets continue to be forwarded to mobile (but
with new care-of-address)
 mobility, changing foreign networks transparent: on
going connections can be maintained!
