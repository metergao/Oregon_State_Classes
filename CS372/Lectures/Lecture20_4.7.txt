Network Layer 4-1

Terminology






unicast: Direct, host-to-host communication. Can
be across the entire internet.
broadcast: Communication done from one host to
all other hosts on the same subnet.
multicast: Communication done from one or
more hosts to a “subscribed” set of hosts across
multiple subnets. Note that internet routers
block multicast packets, so it’s LAN only.
anycast: Communication done to the closest
subnet that responds. Google uses this to cache
search results physically closer to you. i.e., a
subnet is advertised in multiple places!
Network Layer 4-2

Broadcast routing



deliver packets from source to all other nodes
source duplication is inefficient:

duplication

source duplication: how does source determine all
of the recipient addresses?
Network Layer 4-3

In-network duplication


flooding: when node receives broadcast packet,
sends copy to all neighbors
 problems: cycles & broadcast storm



controlled flooding: node only broadcasts packet if
it hasn’t broadcast same packet before
 node keeps track of packet ids already broadcasted
 or reverse path forwarding (RPF): only forward packet
if it arrived on shortest path between node and source



spanning tree:
 no redundant packets received by any node

Network Layer 4-4

Spanning tree



first construct a spanning tree
nodes then forward/make copies only along
spanning tree

center node
each node sends unicast join message to center
node
 message forwarded until it arrives at a node already
belonging to spanning tree

Multicast routing: problem statement
goal: find a tree (or trees) connecting routers having
local multicast group members




tree: not all paths between routers used
shared-tree: same tree used by all group members
source-based: different tree from each sender to rcvrs

Network Layer 4-7

Approaches for building mcast trees
approaches:
 source-based tree: one tree per source
 shortest path trees
 reverse path forwarding


group-shared tree: group uses one tree
 minimal spanning (Steiner)
 center-based trees

…we first look at basic approaches, then specific protocols
adopting these approaches

Network Layer 4-8

Shortest path tree


multicast forwarding tree: tree of shortest path
routes from source to all receivers
 Dijkstra’s algorithm

Network Layer 4-9

Reverse path forwarding
rely on router’s knowledge of unicast shortest
path from it to sender
 each router has simple forwarding behavior:


if (multicast datagram received on incoming link on
shortest path back to center)
then flood datagram onto all outgoing links
else ignore datagram

Network Layer 4-10

Reverse path forwarding: example

datagram will be forwarded

R3
R6

R7
datagram will not be
forwarded



result is a source-specific reverse SPT
 may be a bad choice with asymmetric links
Network Layer 4-11

Reverse path forwarding: pruning


forwarding tree contains subtrees with no multicast group
members
 no need to forward datagrams down subtree
 “prune” messages sent upstream by router with no
downstream group members

Shared-tree: steiner tree






steiner tree: minimum cost tree connecting all
routers with attached group members
problem is NP-complete
excellent heuristics exists
not used in practice:

 computational complexity
 information about entire network needed
 monolithic: rerun whenever a router needs to
join/leave

Network Layer 4-13

Center-based trees




single delivery tree shared by all
one router identified as “center” of tree
to join:
 edge router sends unicast join-msg addressed to center
router
 join-msg “processed” by intermediate routers and
forwarded towards center
 join-msg either hits existing tree branch for this center,
or arrives at center
 path taken by join-msg becomes new branch of tree for
this router

Internet Multicasting Routing: DVMRP



DVMRP: distance vector multicast routing
protocol, RFC1075
flood and prune: reverse path forwarding, sourcebased tree
 RPF tree based on DVMRP’s own routing tables
constructed by communicating DVMRP routers
 no assumptions about underlying unicast
 initial datagram to multicast group flooded
everywhere via RPF
 routers not wanting group: send upstream prune
messages

Network Layer 4-16

DVMRP: continued…


soft state: DVMRP router periodically (1 min.)
“forgets” branches are pruned:

 multicast data again flows down unpruned branch
 downstream router: reprune or else continue to receive
data


routers can quickly regraft to tree
 following IGMP join at leaf



odds and ends
 commonly implemented in commercial router

Network Layer 4-17

Tunneling
Q: how to connect “islands” of multicast routers in a
“sea” of unicast routers?

physical topology





logical topology

multicast datagram encapsulated inside “normal” (nonmulticast-addressed) datagram
normal IP datagram sent through “tunnel” via regular IP
unicast to receiving multicast router (recall IPv6 inside IPv4
tunneling)
receiving multicast router un-encapsulates to get multicast
Network Layer 4-18
datagram

PIM: Protocol Independent Multicast




not dependent on any specific underlying unicast
routing algorithm (works with all)

two different multicast distribution scenarios :

dense:




group members densely
packed, in “close”
proximity.
bandwidth more plentiful

sparse:





# networks with group
members small wrt #
interconnected networks
group members “widely
dispersed”
bandwidth not plentiful
Network Layer 4-19

Consequences of sparse-dense dichotomy:
dense

sparse:








group membership by
routers assumed until
routers explicitly prune
data-driven construction on
multicast tree (e.g., RPF)
bandwidth and non-grouprouter processing is
profligate





no membership until routers
explicitly join
receiver-driven construction of
multicast tree (e.g., centerbased)
bandwidth and non-grouprouter processing is
conservative

Network Layer 4-20

PIM- dense mode
flood-and-prune RPF: similar to DVMRP but…
underlying unicast protocol provides RPF info
for incoming datagram
 less complicated (less efficient) downstream
flood than DVMRP reduces reliance on
underlying routing algorithm
 has protocol mechanism for router to detect it
is a leaf-node router


Network Layer 4-21

PIM - sparse mode





center-based approach
router sends join msg to
rendezvous point (RP)
 intermediate routers
update state and
forward join
after joining via RP, router
can switch to sourcespecific tree
 increased
performance: less
concentration, shorter
paths
