Network Layer 4-4

Two key network-layer functions




forwarding: move packets
from router’s input to
appropriate router
output
routing: determine route
taken by packets from
source to dest.
 routing algorithms

analogy:




routing: process of
planning trip from source
to dest
forwarding: process of
getting through single
interchange

Connection setup


3rd important function in some network
architectures:
 ATM, frame relay, X.25



before datagrams flow, two end hosts and
intervening routers establish virtual connection
 routers get involved



network vs transport layer connection service:
 network: between two hosts (may also involve intervening
routers in case of VCs)
 transport: between two processes

Network Layer 4-7

Network service model
Q: What service model for “channel” transporting
datagrams from sender to receiver?
example services for
individual datagrams:




guaranteed delivery
guaranteed delivery with
less than 40 msec delay

example services for a flow
of datagrams:




in-order datagram
delivery
guaranteed minimum
bandwidth to a flow
restrictions on changes in
inter-packet spacing
(controls jitter)

Connection, connection-less service





datagram network provides network-layer
connectionless service
virtual-circuit network provides network-layer
connection service
analogous to TCP/UDP connecton-oriented /
connectionless transport-layer services, but:
 service: host-to-host
 no choice: network provides one or the other
 implementation: in network core

Network Layer 4-11

Virtual circuits
“source-to-dest path behaves much like telephone
circuit”
 performance-wise
 network actions along source-to-dest path





call setup, teardown for each call before data can flow
each packet carries VC identifier (not destination host
address)
every router on source-dest path maintains “state” for
each passing connection
link, router resources (bandwidth, buffers) may be
allocated to VC (dedicated resources = predictable
service)
Network Layer 4-12

VC implementation
a VC consists of:
1. path from source to destination
2. VC numbers, one number for each link along path
3. entries in forwarding tables in routers along path



packet belonging to VC carries VC number
(rather than dest address)
VC number can be changed on each link.


new VC number comes from forwarding table

Q: but what happens if ranges don’t divide up so nicely?
Network Layer 4-18

Longest prefix matching
longest prefix matching

when looking for forwarding table entry for given destination
address, use longest address prefix that matches destination
address, because it’s more specific.

Datagram vs VC network: origins
Internet (datagram)


data exchange among
computers

ATM (VC)



 strict timing, reliability
requirements
 need for guaranteed service

 “elastic” service, no strict
timing req.


many link types
 different characteristics
 uniform service difficult



“smart” end systems
(computers)

evolved from telephony
human conversation:



“dumb” end systems
 telephones
 complexity inside
network

 can adapt, perform control,
error recovery
 simple inside network,
complexity at “edge”
