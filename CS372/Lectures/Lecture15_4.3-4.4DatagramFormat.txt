What is a router?



Modern routers have varying amounts of input ports and
output ports.
Home-grade, SMB “routers” typically have the following
internal components:







Switch
Router
Firewall
Wireless Radio

Advanced devices often have:




VPN
Port Forwarding
QoS (Quality of Service)
Separate control over each port

Network Layer 4-2

Router (only) architecture overview
two key router functions:



run routing algorithms/protocol (RIP, OSPF, BGP)
forwarding datagrams from incoming to outgoing link

forwarding tables computed,
pushed to input ports

physical layer:

see chapter 5

decentralized switching:






given datagram dest., lookup output port
using forwarding table in input port
memory (“match plus action”)
goal: complete input port processing at
‘line speed’
queuing: if datagrams arrive faster than
forwarding rate into switch fabric
Network Layer 4-4

Switching fabrics



transfer packet from input buffer to appropriate
output buffer
switching rate: rate at which packets can be
transfer from inputs to outputs
 often measured as multiple of input/output line rate
 N inputs: switching rate N times line rate desirable



three types of switching fabrics
memory

memory

bus

crossbar

first generation routers:
 traditional

computers with switching under direct control

of CPU
 packet copied to system’s memory
 speed limited by memory bandwidth (2 bus crossings per
datagram)

Switching via a bus





datagram from input port memory
copied to output port memory via
a shared bus
bus contention: switching speed
limited by bus bandwidth
32 Gbps bus, Cisco 5600: sufficient
speed for access and enterprise
routers

bus

Network Layer 4-7

Switching via interconnection network








overcome bus bandwidth limitations
banyan networks, crossbar, other
interconnection nets initially
developed to connect processors in
multiprocessor
advanced design: fragmenting
datagram into fixed length cells,
switch cells through the fabric.
Cisco 12000: switches 60 Gbps
through the interconnection

Output port queueing

switch

at time t, packets move
from input to output




switch

one packet time later

buffering when arrival rate via switch exceeds
output line speed
queueing (delay) and loss due to output port buffer
overflow!
Network Layer 4-10

How much buffering?


RFC 3439 rule of thumb: average buffering equal to
“typical” RTT (say 250 msec) times link capacity C
 e.g., 250ms * 10 Gbps => 2.5 Gbit buffer



recent recommendation: with N TCP “flows”,
buffering equal to RTT . C
N

thus, with RTT = 0.25s, C = 10 Gbps, and 10 flows:
 e.g., (0.25s * 10 Gbps) / sqrt(10) => 0.79 Gbit buffer

Network Layer 4-11

Input port queuing




fabric slower than input ports combined -> queueing may
occur at input queues,
 queueing delay and loss due to input buffer overflow!
Head-of-the-Line (HOL) blocking: queued datagram at front
of queue prevents others in queue from moving forward

switch
fabric

output port contention:
Assume only one red datagram
can be transferred per time t.
lower red packet is blocked

switch
fabric

one packet time later: green
packet experiences HOL
blocking - can’t be sent, even
though it’s desired output is
not busy!

IP fragmentation, reassembly


fragmentation:
in: one large datagram
out: 3 smaller datagrams

…



reassembly

…

network links have MTU
(max.transfer size) largest possible link-level
frame
 different link types,
different MTUs
large IP datagram divided
(“fragmented”) within net
 one datagram becomes
several datagrams
 “reassembled” only at
final destination
 IP header bits used to
identify, order related
fragments

Network Layer 4-16

IP fragmentation, reassembly





4000 byte datagram
MTU = 1500 bytes
1480 bytes in

one large datagram becomes

=1500 =x

=185
