Wireless, Mobile Networks 6-10

Wireless Link Characteristics (1)
important differences from wired link ….
 decreased signal strength: radio signal attenuates as it
propagates through matter (path loss)
 interference from other sources: standardized wireless
network frequencies (e.g., 2.4 GHz) shared by other
devices (e.g., phone); devices (motors, microwaves)
interfere as well
 multipath propagation: radio signal reflects off objects
ground, arriving at destination at slightly different
times
…. make communication across (even a point to point)
wireless link much more difficult
Wireless, Mobile Networks 6-11

Wireless Link Characteristics (2)


SNR: signal-to-noise ratio

10-1

 larger SNR – easier to
extract signal from noise (a
“good thing”)

SNR versus BER tradeoffs
 given physical layer: increase
power -> increase SNR
-> decrease Bit Error Rate
 given SNR: choose physical layer
that meets BER requirement,
giving highest throughput
• SNR may change with
mobility, so dynamically
adapt physical layer
(modulation technique, rate)

Wireless, Mobile Networks 6-13

Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)


unique “code” assigned to each user; i.e., code set
partitioning
 all users share same frequency, but each user has own
“chipping” sequence (i.e., code) to encode data
 allows multiple users to “coexist” and transmit
simultaneously with minimal interference (if codes are
“orthogonal”)

encoded signal = (original data) X (chipping
sequence)
 decoding: inner-product of encoded signal and
chipping sequence

channels at different frequencies
 AP admin chooses frequency for AP
 interference possible: channel can be same as that
chosen by neighboring AP!



host: must associate with an AP
 scans channels, listening for beacon frames containing
AP’s name (SSID) and MAC address
 selects AP to associate with
 may perform authentication [Chapter 8]
 will typically run DHCP to get IP address in AP’s
subnet

IEEE 802.11: multiple access



avoid collisions: 2+ nodes transmitting at same time
802.11: CSMA - sense before transmitting
 don’t collide with ongoing transmission by other node



802.11: no collision detection!
 difficult to receive (sense collisions) when transmitting due to weak
received signals (fading)
 can’t sense all collisions in any case: hidden terminal, fading
 goal: avoid collisions: CSMA/C(ollision)A(voidance)

Wireless, Mobile Networks 6-23

Avoiding collisions (more)
idea: allow sender to “reserve” channel rather than random
access of data frames: avoid collisions of long data frames
 sender first transmits small request-to-send (RTS) packets
to BS using CSMA
 RTSs may still collide with each other (but they’re short)



BS broadcasts clear-to-send CTS in response to RTS
CTS heard by all nodes
 sender transmits data frame
 other stations defer transmissions

avoid data frame collisions completely
using small reservation packets!

sent; otherwise sleep again until next beacon frame
