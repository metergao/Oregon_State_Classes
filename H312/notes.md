*Public Health*
    Fulfilling society's intrest in assuring conditiots in which people can be healthy.
    _3 Core Functions_
        1) Assessment & Monitoring 
            * Analogous to diagnosis, but at pop level
        2) Assurance
            * Treament
            * Access to quality health promotion
        3) Policy develompemnt

Social Justice:
    Benefits and burdens of society are not evenly distributed.
Inherently Political:
    Social justice underpinnings stimulate political conflict.
Linking with Government
    Government enforces policies that limit prersonal and property rights of individuals and corporations.
Grounded in Science
    Basic sciences of PH: epidemiology, biostatistics, environmental science.
Focus on prevention
    Prevention - actions that are taken to reduce the possibility that something will happen.

PH as a "zero-sum game"
    Limited funding at all levels of PH promotion.
    Privatie interests vs. the healtth of the public.

Basic Epidemiology
    The study of how disease is distributed in populations.

    Risk factors:
        * Individual Risk
        * Peer/sociol risk
        * Family risk
        * Community risk


Epidemiological Triangle
                                                        Host
                                            Age, Sex, race, genetices



                                Agent                                          Environment
                    Biologicol (virus, bacteria)                         Temp, Altitude, crowding

Etiology    - Study of the cause or origins of an illness or disease and the relevant risk factors.
Endemic     - The habitual presence of a disease within a given geographic area. 
Epidemic    - The occurrence of a group of illnesses in a geographical area
Pandemic    - International.

Primary prevention     - Action taken to prevent the development of disease in a person who is well and does not have the disease in question.
Secondary prevention    - Identifying people in whom a disease has already begun but who have not yet developed clinical signs.
Tertiary prevention     - Prevention complications in those who have contracted the disease. 

Prevention approach
    1) Population-based approach
        * Preventative mesuers is widely applied to a population
    2) High-risk approach 
        * Targeted to high risk individuals.

Social Determinants of Health
Biological determinants of health   

AIDS - Acquired immune Deficiency Syndrome

Syndrome vs Disease
    Disease     - Single identifiable condition
    Syndrome    - Multiple conditions

Fear and stigma
    Fear of cosual contact spread
        * Continues after it is confirmed that one cannot casually become infected with HIV
    Effect of leadership
        * Ronald reagan
            - Did not acknowledge AIDS as an issue for years
            - Witheld scientific information that contradicted casual transmition.

HIV
    * ~2.5 years after the first reported AIDS case, HIV was isolated.
    * A single virus that causes AIDS

The Dark Era
    * [1981-1983]
        - Disease etiology unknown
        - People were dieing 1-2 years after being infected.

    * At the time of virus isolation:
        - 5 years of no treatement

    * First antiretroviral treatment
        - AZT(1987) - almost as lethal as the virus

Defining AIDS
    * Challenging
        - No single characteristtic of AIDS tat allows for a useful difinition for surveillance purposes.

    * Based early definitions of Ols in men
        - Failed to acknowledge different disease coures in females.
        - Women incuded in definition in 1993
    
    * Definition broadened over time.

STIs - 20th Century
    * Syphilis and gonorrhea were the most common STIs

IRB - Institutional review board to protect human subjects.

Belmont Report
    1) Respect for persons
    2) Beneficence
    3) Justice
