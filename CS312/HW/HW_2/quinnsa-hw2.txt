Questions

1. Explain the function of each of the following DNS records:
    PTR   - Pointer to a canonical name.
    MX    - Maps to a the message transfer agents for the given domain. 
    TXT   - Human readable txt about the given domain.
    CNAME - Alias of one domain name to another.
    SOA   - Authoritative information about the DNS zone.
    AAAA  - The 128 bit IPv6 address.

2. Describe the diﬀerence between an authoritative DNS server and a recursive DNS server.

    An authoritative DNS server will return an absolute path to the requested domain. Authroative servers are the offical repersetations of a zone. A recursive DNS server will either return a cached value of where it thinks that the Authoratative server resides or will point the request to a DNS server that would know better. 

3. MX records can be used on CNAME records

    (a) True - They can but is prohibited by RFC 2181

4. Which DNS record is typically used to assist in classless PTR delega-
tion?
    
    CNAMES can be exploited to provide reverse mappings for a subnet. 

5. Describe why conﬁguring remote logging is important.
    
    It is a good idea to setup remote logging so if in the case of a security breach there is no way for a hacker to delete their trace. It also seperates the single point of failure so if the server hard drive are unreadable you could still view the logs.

6. Name the two logging applications that are running on CentOS 7.
    
    rsyslog
    journalctl

7. What signal does logrotate typically send to applications to release
ﬁle handles?
    
    -HUP

8. Provide the journalctl command which will list all of the logs for
the kernel.
    
    journalctl -f _TRANSPORT=kernel

9. Provide a single crontab entry that would do all of the following:
    • Run every Tuesday and Thursday
    • Starting at 1am, every third hour it runs once every 10 minutes.
For example, it should run at 1:10, 1:20, etc and then at 4:10,
4:20, etc.

    */10 1/3 * * 2,4 /path/to/script

10. Which directory allows for arbitrary crontab formatted ﬁles used by
crond?

    (a) /etc/cron.d

11. Software RAID6 can be used for /boot with any version of grub.

    (a) True

12. Which ﬁle provides the current status of the software RAID devices?

    (b) /proc/mdstat

13. Correctly order the commands that should be used to create an LVM
volume and then mount that volume.

    1. pvcreate /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1
    2. vgcreate data /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1
    3. lvcreate -n misc -L 100G data
    4. mkfs.ext4 /dev/data/misc
    5. mount /dev/data/misc /mnt

14. Which RAID level provides a mirrored set of striped drives?

    (c) RAID6

15. Correctly order the network boot install steps:

    1. System start up, BIOS check
    2. Grabs the initial boot image
    3. Gets an IP address and information on where the TFTP server is
    4. PXELINUX downloads Linux kernel/initrd image and sends any
       kernel arguments
    5. Boot from network device

16. Provide the list of Anaconda boot options that would do the following:

    (a) Set the IP statically to 192.168.5.100
            network --bootproto=static --ip=192.168.5.100
    (b) Assuming the subnet is a /24 and the gateway is 192.168.5.1,
        set the correct gateway and netmask.
            network --netmask=255.255.255.0 --gateway=192.168.5.1
    (c) Set the DNS nameserver to 192.168.5.130 and 192.168.5.131
            network --nameserver=192.168.5.130 --nameserver=192.168.5.131
    (d) Enable the VNC GUI installer with the password set to cs312
            vnc --localhost --port=5900 --password=cs312w16
    (e) Use the Kickstart ﬁle from an NFS ﬁle share on
        192.168.5.2:/kickstart/ks.cfg
            linux ks=192.168.5.2:/kickstart/ks.cfg

using systemd: systemctl httpd restart

    (b) False

19. Which systemd service type should be used for a command that is just
run and then exits?

    (d) oneshot

20. What are systemd Targets roughly equal to in the SystemV world?

    (b) Run levels
