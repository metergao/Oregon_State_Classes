CS444
====================
This course is intended as an introduction to the implementation of a modern operating system. This will involve implementing pieces of the Linux kernel, as well as additional coding projects intended to further your understanding.

Topics covered will include:
    Concurrency

	I/O scheduling

    CPU Scheduling	

	Deadlock

	Virtual Memory

	File systems 

It is assumed that a basic C knowledge is had by all students in the class. This includes syntax, flow control constructs, basic function usage, and pointers. Basic UNIX/Linux knowledge is also assumed. Please see resources page for helpful information if you feel lacking in these areas.

You will be allowed to use your choice of editor: either vi(m) or emacs. I strongly suggest you avoid editors such as pico or nano, as they are not development oriented editors. Personally, I am an emacs user, and have provided a complete .emacs file on the resources page.
