As discussed in class, HW5 is a project which will help you with the final paper.

Each student, individually, will be creating an annotated bibliography in LaTeX, complete with a bibtex file containing all mentioned sources. For each source, provide a minimum of a paragraph summary. For the purposes of this assignment, treat each chapter in a given source as its own entry.

Each individual will be required to submit their write-up in LaTeX format in a tarball labelled CS444_project5.tar.bz2 which should also include a makefile. This makefile should invoke bibtex.
