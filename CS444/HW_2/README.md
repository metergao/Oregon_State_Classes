In this project you will be developing your solution on the virtual machine. Using the default Linux 3.0.4 kernel, you are asked to implement the following:
	* Implement the Shortest Seek Time First(SSTF) I/O scheduler
Develop your solution based off the currect FIFO (noop) implementation currently in the block directory. You will be required to write a new file titled sstf-iosched.c.

The source repo from which to export is svn+ssh://os-class.engr.oregonstate.edu/scratch/cs411/linux. You will be using this source tree for the remainder of the projects.

To receive full credit, your solution must be correct and working on the hardware provided.
You are also required to do the following:
	* Group write-up: Prepare a document containing the design you plan to use to implement the following algorithms.
	* Individual write-up: Answer the following questions in sufficient detail:
		1. What do you think the main point of this assignment is?
		2. How did you personally approach the problem? Design decisions, algorithm, etc.
		3. How did you ensure your solution was correct? Testing details, for instance.
		4. What did you learn?
Make sure your group submission is a tarball labelled CS444_project2_group#.tar.bz2 and includes the following:
	* A linux patch file containing your solution
	* The group write-up in LaTeX format.
	* A makefile for the LaTeX file.
Each individual will be required to submit their individual write-up in LaTeX format with a makefile also conatined in a tarball labelled CS444_project2_writeup.tar.bz2
