Mobile IP
RFC 3344
 has many features we’ve seen:


 home agents, foreign agents, foreign-agent registration,
care-of-addresses, encapsulation (packet-within-apacket)


three mainparts:
 agent discovery
 registration with home agent
 indirect routing of datagrams

Mobile IP agent discovery


Agent discovery dictates how a mobile agent
discovers information about the home or foreign
agent it has just connected to

Mobile IP registration


Agent discovery gets the mobile agent the
information it needs; the next step is to phone
home



The registration process dictates how the mobile
agent registers care of addresses (COAs) with it’s
home agent.

reasons for handoff:

 load balance: free up channel in

3. new BSS allocates radio channel for
use by mobile
4. new BSS signals MSC and old BSS:
ready for handoff
5. old BSS tells mobile: perform handoff to
new BSS
6. mobile and new BSS communicate to
activate new channel

Wireless, mobility: impact on higher layer protocols


logically, impact should be minimal …
 best effort service model remains unchanged
 TCP and UDP can (and do) run over wireless, mobile



… but performance-wise:
 packet loss/delay due to bit-errors (discarded packets,
delays for link-layer retransmissions), and handoff
 TCP interprets loss as congestion, will decrease congestion
window unnecessarily
 delay impairments for real-time traffic
 limited bandwidth of wireless links
Wireless, Mobile Networks 6-17

Wireless, mobility: impact on higher layer protocols


Three broad classes of approaches to solve this
unnecessary drop in transfer rate:
 Local recovery
 TCP sender awareness of wireless links
 Split-connection approaches

Wireless, Mobile Networks 6-18

Wireless, mobility: Local recovery


Attempts to solve the local bit errors that occur
before “alerting” TCP to their presence by sending or
dropping mangled packets
 802.11ARQ : Automatic Repeat reQuest
• Allows the link-layer nodes to request retransmissions similar to
TCP
• Uses a sliding window of packets under consideration – places
limits on number of packets being communicated at once



Hardware has to be specifically built for this

Wireless, Mobile Networks 6-19

Wireless, mobility: TCP sender awareness
Hosts are explicitly aware of wireless links, and are
tolerant of the different types of losses
 Distinguishes between congestion losses, and
corruption/loss events


Wireless, Mobile Networks 6-20

Wireless, mobility: Split-connection approaches
Splits up a TCP connection into two segments: the
wired component, and the wireless component
 The original sender and destination are unaware of
the packet manipulation going on
 The segment over the wireless link can be either a
TCP connection or a specially-crafted error recovery
protocol on top of UDP


 Q: What does error recovery on top of UDP look like?
