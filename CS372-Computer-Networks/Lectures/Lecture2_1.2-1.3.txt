Introduction 1-14

The network core




mesh of interconnected
routers
packet-switching: hosts
break application-layer
messages into packets
 forward packets from one
router to the next, across
links on path from source
to destination
 each packet transmitted at
full link capacity

Introduction 1-15

Packet-switching: store-and-forward
L bits
per packet
source






3 2 1

R bps

takes L/R seconds to
transmit (push out) L-bit
packet into link at R bps
store and forward: entire
packet must arrive at router
before it can be transmitted
on next link
end-end delay = 2L/R (assuming
zero propagation delay)

R bps

destination

one-hop numerical example:
 L = 7.5 Mbits
 R = 1.5 Mbps
 one-hop transmission
delay = 5 sec
more on delay shortly …
Introduction 1-16

Packet Switching: queueing delay, loss
A

C

R = 100 Mb/s

R = 1.5 Mb/s

B

D
E

queue of packets
waiting for output link

queuing and loss:


If arrival rate (in bits) to link exceeds transmission rate of
link for a period of time:
 packets will queue, wait to be transmitted on link
 packets can be dropped (lost) if memory (buffer) fills up
Introduction 1-17

Two key network-core functions
routing: determines sourcedestination route taken by
packets
 routing algorithms

forwarding: move packets from
router’s input to appropriate
router output

Network Layer 4-18

Alternative core: circuit switching
end-end resources allocated
to, reserved for “call”
between source & dest:







In diagram, each link has four
circuits.
 call gets 2nd circuit in top
link and 1st circuit in right
link.
dedicated resources: no sharing
 circuit-like (guaranteed)
performance
circuit segment idle if not used
by call (no sharing)
Commonly used in traditional
telephone networks

Introduction 1-19

Circuit switching: FDM versus TDM
Example:
FDM

4 users
frequency

TDM

frequency

Introduction 1-20

Packet switching versus circuit switching
packet switching allows more users to use network!
example:
 1 Mb/s link
 each user:

• 100 kb/s when “active”
• active 10% of time

N
users
1 Mbps link

 circuit-switching:

 10 users
 packet

switching:

 with 35 users, probability >
10 active at same time is less
than .0004 *

Q: how did we get value 0.0004?
Q: what happens if > 35 users ?

* Check out the online interactive exercises for more examples

Introduction 1-21

Packet switching versus circuit switching
is packet switching a “slam dunk winner?”






great for bursty data
 resource sharing
 simpler, no call setup
excessive congestion possible: packet delay and loss
 protocols needed for reliable data transfer, congestion
control
Q: How to provide circuit-like behavior?
 bandwidth guarantees needed for audio/video apps
 still an unsolved problem (chapter 7)

Q: human analogies of reserved resources (circuit switching)
versus on-demand allocation (packet-switching)?
Introduction 1-22

Internet structure: network of networks







End systems connect to Internet via access ISPs (Internet
Service Providers)
 Residential, company and university ISPs
Access ISPs in turn must be interconnected.
 So that any two hosts can send packets to each other
Resulting network of networks is very complex
 Evolution was driven by economics and national policies
Let’s take a stepwise approach to describe current Internet
structure

together?
