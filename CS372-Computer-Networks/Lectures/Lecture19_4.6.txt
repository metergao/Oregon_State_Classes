Network Layer 4-1

Intra-AS Routing



also known as interior gateway protocols (IGP)
most common intra-AS routing protocols:
 RIP: Routing Information Protocol
 OSPF: Open Shortest Path First
 IGRP: Interior Gateway Routing Protocol
(Cisco proprietary)

Network Layer 4-2

RIP ( Routing Information Protocol)



included in BSD-UNIX distribution in 1982
distance vector algorithm
 distance metric: # hops (max = 15 hops), each link has cost 1
 DVs exchanged with neighbors every 30 sec in response message (aka
advertisement)
 each advertisement: list of up to 25 destination subnets (in IP addressing
sense)

Network Layer 4-5

RIP: link failure, recovery
if no advertisement heard after 180 sec -->
neighbor/link declared dead
 routes via neighbor invalidated
 new advertisements sent to neighbors
 neighbors in turn send out new advertisements (if tables
changed)
 link failure info quickly (?) propagates to entire net
 poison reverse used to prevent ping-pong loops (infinite
distance = 16 hops)

Network Layer 4-6

RIP table processing

process called route-d (daemon)

OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)



“open”: publicly available
uses link state algorithm
 LS packet dissemination
 topology map at each node
 route computation using Dijkstra’s algorithm



OSPF advertisement carries one entry per neighbor,
but advertisements flooded to entire AS
 carried in OSPF messages directly over IP (rather than
TCP or UDP



IS-IS routing protocol: nearly identical to OSPF

Network Layer 4-8

OSPF “advanced” features (not in RIP)








security: all OSPF messages authenticated (to prevent
malicious intrusion)
multiple same-cost paths allowed (only one path in
RIP)
for each link, multiple cost metrics for different TOS
(e.g., satellite link cost set “low” for best effort ToS;
high for real time ToS)
integrated uni- and multicast support:
 Multicast OSPF (MOSPF) uses same topology data
base as OSPF
hierarchical OSPF in large domains.

Hierarchical OSPF






two-level hierarchy: local area, backbone.
 link-state advertisements only in area
 each node has detailed area topology; only know
direction (shortest path) to nets in other areas.
area border routers: “summarize” distances to nets in
own area, advertise to other Area Border routers.
backbone routers: run OSPF routing limited to
backbone.
boundary routers: connect to other AS’s.

Network Layer 4-11

Internet inter-AS routing: BGP


BGP (Border Gateway Protocol): the de facto
inter-domain routing protocol
 “glue that holds the Internet together”



BGP provides each AS a means to:
 eBGP: obtain subnet reachability information from

neighboring ASs.
 iBGP: propagate reachability information to all ASinternal routers.
 determine “good” routes to other networks based on
reachability information and policy.



allows subnet to advertise its existence to rest of
Internet: “I am here”
Network Layer 4-12

BGP basics


BGP session: two BGP routers (“peers”) exchange BGP
messages:
 advertising paths to different destination network prefixes (“path vector”
protocol)
 exchanged over semi-permanent TCP connections



when AS3 advertises a prefix to AS1:
 AS3 promises it will forward datagrams towards that prefix
 AS3 can aggregate prefixes in its advertisement

Network Layer 4-13

BGP basics: distributing path information


using eBGP session between 3a and 1c, AS3 sends prefix
reachability info to AS1.
 1c can then use iBGP do distribute new prefix info to all routers
in AS1
 1b can then re-advertise new reachability info to AS2 over 1b-to2a eBGP session



when router learns of new prefix, it creates entry for
prefix in its forwarding table.

Path attributes and BGP routes


advertised prefix includes BGP attributes
 prefix + attributes = “route”



two important attributes:
 AS-PATH: contains ASs through which prefix
advertisement has passed: e.g., AS 67, AS 17
 NEXT-HOP: indicates specific internal-AS router to nexthop AS. (may be multiple links from current AS to nexthop-AS)



gateway router receiving route advertisement uses
import policy to accept/decline
 e.g., never route through AS x
 policy-based routing
Network Layer 4-15

BGP route selection


router may learn about more than 1 route to
destination AS, selects route based on:
1.
2.
3.
4.

local preference value attribute: policy decision
shortest AS-PATH
closest NEXT-HOP router: hot potato routing
additional criteria

Network Layer 4-16

BGP messages



BGP messages exchanged between peers over TCP
connection
BGP messages:
 OPEN: opens TCP connection to peer and authenticates
sender
 UPDATE: advertises new path (or withdraws old)
 KEEPALIVE: keeps connection alive in absence of
UPDATES; also ACKs OPEN request
 NOTIFICATION: reports errors in previous msg; also
used to close connection

Putting it Altogether:
How Does an Entry Get Into a
Router’s Forwarding Table? (pp396)

Answer is complicated!
Ties together hierarchical routing (Section 4.5.3)
with BGP (4.6.3) and OSPF (4.6.2).

Has to select one route

Select best BGP route to prefix




Router selects route based on shortest AS-PATH
Example:





select

AS2 AS17 to 138.16.64/22
AS3 AS131 AS201 to 138.16.64/22

What if there is a tie? We’ll come back to that!

Find best intra-route to BGP route


Use selected route’s NEXT-HOP attribute:
 Route’s NEXT-HOP attribute is the IP address of the
router interface that begins the AS PATH.



Example:




AS-PATH: AS2 AS17 ; NEXT-HOP: 111.99.86.55

Router uses OSPF to find shortest path from 1c to
111.99.86.55

Hot Potato Routing



Suppose there two or more best inter-routes.
Then choose route with closest NEXT-HOP
 Use OSPF to determine which gateway is closest
 Q: From 1c, chose AS3 AS131 or AS2 AS17?
 A: route AS3 AS131 since it is closer (only one hop away)

A,B,C are provider networks
X,W,Y are customer (of provider networks)
X is dual-homed: attached to two networks
 X does not want to route from B via X to C
 … so X will not advertise to B a route to C!

(paying

A advertises path AW to B
B advertises path BAW to X
Should B advertise path BAW to C?

 No way! B gets no “revenue” for routing CBAW since neither W nor
C are B’s customers
 B wants to route only to/from its customers!
 B wants to force C to route to w via A, not via itself

Network Layer 4-29

Why different Intra-, Inter-AS routing ?
policy:



inter-AS: admin wants control over how its traffic
routed, who routes through its net.
intra-AS: single administrative point, so no policy
decisions need to be debated by different companies.

scale:
hierarchical routing saves table size, reduced update
traffic
performance:
 intra-AS: can focus on performance
 inter-AS: policy may dominate over performance
