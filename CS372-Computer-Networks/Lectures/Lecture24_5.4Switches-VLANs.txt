Link Layer

5-1

Ethernet switch






link-layer device: takes an active role
 store, forward Ethernet frames
 examine incoming frame’s MAC address,
selectively forward frame to one-or-more
outgoing links when frame is to be forwarded on
segment, uses CSMA/CD to access segment
transparent
 hosts are unaware of presence of switches
plug-and-play, self-learning
 switches do not need to be configured

Switch: multiple simultaneous transmissions







hosts have dedicated, direct
connection to switch
switches buffer packets
Ethernet protocol used on each
incoming link, but no collisions;
full duplex
 each link is its own collision
domain
switching: A-to-A’ and B-to-B’
can transmit simultaneously,
without collisions

Switch forwarding table
Q: how does switch know A’
reachable via interface 4, B’
reachable via interface 5?
 A: each switch has a switch
table, each entry:
 (MAC address of host, interface to
reach host, time stamp)
 looks like a routing table!

 something like a routing protocol?
Link Layer

Switch: self-learning


switch learns which hosts
can be reached through
which interfaces
 (only) when frame
received, switch
“learns” location of
sender’s incoming LAN
segment
 records sender/location
pair in switch table

Remember: no ACKs
when sending Ethernet
frames!

Switch: frame filtering/forwarding
when frame received at switch:
1. record incoming link, MAC address of sending host
2. index switch table using MAC destination address
3. if entry found for destination, then
{
if destination on segment from which frame arrived
then drop frame
else
forward frame on interface indicated by entry
}
else flood // forward on all interfaces except arriving one

Q: sending from A to G - how does S1 know to

Link Layer 5-10

Switches vs. routers
both are store-and-forward:
 routers: network-layer
devices (examine networklayer headers)
 switches: link-layer devices
(examine link-layer
headers)
both have forwarding tables:
 routers: compute tables
using routing algorithms, IP
addresses
 switches: learn forwarding
table using flooding,
learning, MAC addresses

Computer
Engineering

CS user moves office to
EE, but wants connect to
CS switch?
single broadcast domain:
 all layer-2 broadcast
traffic (ARP, DHCP,
unknown location of
destination MAC
address) must cross
entire LAN
 security/privacy,
efficiency issues

Link Layer 5-12

VLANs

port-based VLAN: switch ports
grouped (by switch management
software) so that single physical
switch ……

Virtual Local
Area Network

switch(es) supporting
VLAN capabilities can
be configured to
define multiple virtual
LANS over single
physical LAN
infrastructure.

Port-based VLAN


 can also define VLAN based on
MAC addresses of endpoints,
rather than switch port




router

traffic isolation: frames to/from
ports 1-8 can only reach ports
1-8

dynamic membership: ports
can be dynamically assigned
among VLANs

trunk port: carries frames between VLANS defined over
multiple physical switches
 frames forwarded within VLAN between switches can’t be vanilla 802.1
frames (must carry VLAN ID info)
