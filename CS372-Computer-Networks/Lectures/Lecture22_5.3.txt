Multiple access links, protocols
two types of “links”:
 point-to-point
 PPP for dial-up access
 point-to-point link between Ethernet switch, host


broadcast (shared wire or medium)
 old-fashioned Ethernet
 upstream HFC
 802.11 wireless LAN

shared wire (e.g.,
cabled Ethernet)

shared RF
(e.g., 802.11 WiFi)

Multiple access protocols



single shared broadcast channel
two or more simultaneous transmissions by nodes:
interference
 collision if node receives two or more signals at the same
time

multiple access protocol



distributed algorithm that determines how nodes share
channel, i.e., determine when node can transmit
communication about channel sharing must use channel itself!
 no out-of-band channel for coordination

Link Layer

5-3

An ideal multiple access protocol
given: broadcast channel of rate R bps
desiderata:
1. when one node wants to transmit, it can send at rate R.
2. when M nodes want to transmit, each can send at average
rate R/M
3. fully decentralized:
• no special node to coordinate transmissions
• no synchronization of clocks, slots
4. simple

Link Layer

5-4

MAC protocols: taxonomy
three broad classes:
 channel partitioning
 divide channel into smaller “pieces” (time slots, frequency, code)
 allocate piece to node for exclusive use


random access
 channel not divided, allow collisions
 “recover” from collisions



“taking turns”
 nodes take turns, but nodes with more to send can take longer
turns

Link Layer

Channel partitioning MAC protocols: TDMA
TDMA: time division multiple access






access to channel in "rounds"
each station gets fixed length slot (length = packet
transmission time) in each round
unused slots go idle
example: 6-station LAN, 1,3,4 have packet, slots
2,5,6 idle

Channel partitioning MAC protocols: FDMA
FDMA: frequency division multiple access





channel spectrum divided into frequency bands
each station assigned fixed frequency band
unused transmission time in frequency bands go idle
example: 6-station LAN, 1,3,4 have packets, frequency bands
2,5,6 idle
Requires frequency that can be divided

Random access protocols


when node has packet to send

 transmit at full channel data rate R.
 no a priori coordination among nodes




two or more transmitting nodes ➜ “collision”,
random access protocol specifies:
 how to detect collisions
 how to recover from collisions (e.g., via delayed
retransmissions)



examples of random access protocols:
 slotted ALOHA
 ALOHA
 CSMA, CSMA/CD, CSMA/CA

Link Layer

5-8

Slotted ALOHA
assumptions:








all frames same size
time divided into equal size
slots (time to transmit 1
frame)
nodes start to transmit
only at slot beginning
all nodes are synchronized
to clock
if 2 or more nodes transmit
in slot, all nodes detect
collision

operation:


when node obtains fresh
frame, transmits in next slot
 if no collision: node can send
new frame in next slot
 if collision: node retransmits
frame in each subsequent
slot with prob. p until
success

Cons:





collisions, wasting slots
idle slots
nodes may be able to
detect collision in less
than time to transmit
packet
clock synchronization
Link Layer 5-10

Slotted ALOHA: efficiency
efficiency: long-run

fraction of successful slots
(many nodes, all with many
frames to send)






suppose: N nodes with
many frames to send, each
transmits in slot with
probability p
prob that given node has
success in a slot = p(1p)N-1
prob that any node has a
success = Np(1-p)N-1





max efficiency: find p* that
maximizes
Np(1-p)N-1
for many nodes, take limit
of Np*(1-p*)N-1 as N goes
to infinity, gives:
max efficiency = 1/e = .37

at best: channel

used for useful
transmissions 37%
of time!

Link Layer 5-11

Pure (unslotted) ALOHA





unslotted Aloha: simpler, no synchronization
when frame first arrives
 transmit immediately
collision probability increases:
 frame sent at t0 collides with other frames sent in [t01,t0+1]

Link Layer 5-12

Pure ALOHA efficiency
P(success by given node) = P(node transmits) .
P(no other node transmits in [t0-1,t0] .
P(no other node transmits in [t0-1,t0]

= p . (1-p)N-1 . (1-p)N-1
= p . (1-p)2(N-1)
… choosing optimum p and then letting n

= 1/(2e) = .18

even worse than slotted Aloha!

Link Layer 5-13

CSMA (carrier sense multiple access)
CSMA: listen before transmit:
if channel sensed idle: transmit entire frame
 if channel sensed busy, defer transmission


human analogy: don’t interrupt others!

Link Layer 5-14

CSMA collisions




spatial layout of nodes

collisions can still occur:
propagation delay means
two nodes may not hear
each other’s
transmission
collision: entire packet
transmission time
wasted
 distance & propagation
delay play role in
determining collision
probability

Link Layer 5-15

CSMA/CD (collision detection)
CSMA/CD: carrier sensing, deferral as in CSMA
 collisions detected within short time
 colliding transmissions aborted, reducing channel wastage


collision detection:
 easy in wired LANs: measure signal strengths, compare
transmitted, received signals
 difficult in wireless LANs: received signal strength
overwhelmed by local transmission strength



human analogy: the polite conversationalist

CSMA/CD (collision detection)
spatial layout of nodes

Link Layer 5-17

Ethernet CSMA/CD algorithm
1. NIC receives datagram
from network layer,
creates frame
2. If NIC senses channel
idle, starts frame
transmission. If NIC
senses channel busy,
waits until channel idle,
then transmits.
3. If NIC transmits entire
frame without detecting
another transmission,
NIC is done with frame !

4. If NIC detects another
transmission while
transmitting, aborts and
sends jam signal
5. After aborting, NIC
enters binary (exponential)
backoff:
 after mth collision, NIC
chooses K at random
from {0,1,2, …, 2m-1}.
NIC waits K·512 bit
times, returns to Step 2
 longer backoff interval
with more collisions
Link Layer 5-18

CSMA/CD efficiency



Tprop = max prop delay between 2 nodes in LAN
ttrans = time to transmit max-size frame

efficiency 




1
1  5t prop /ttrans

efficiency goes to 1
 as tprop goes to 0
 as ttrans goes to infinity
better performance than ALOHA: and simple, cheap,
decentralized!

Link Layer 5-19

“Taking turns” MAC protocols
channel partitioning MAC protocols:
 share channel efficiently and fairly at high load
 inefficient at low load: delay in channel access, 1/N
bandwidth allocated even if only 1 active node!

random access MAC protocols
 efficient at low load: single node can fully utilize
channel
 high load: collision overhead

“taking turns” protocols
look for best of both worlds, but often worse

Link Layer 5-20

“Taking turns” MAC protocols
polling:





master node “invites”
slave nodes to transmit
in turn
