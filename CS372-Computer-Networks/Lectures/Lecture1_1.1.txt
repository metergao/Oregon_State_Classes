Where we’re going
our goal this first week:
 get “feel” and
terminology
 more depth, detail
later in course
 approach:
 use Internet as
example

what’s a protocol?
network edge; hosts, access net,
physical media
network core: packet/circuit
switching, Internet structure
performance: loss, delay,
throughput

Introduction 1-7

What’s the Internet: “nuts and bolts” view


Internet: “network of networks”

mobile network

 Interconnected ISPs


protocols control sending,
receiving of msgs
 e.g., TCP, IP, HTTP, Skype, 802.11



global ISP

Internet standards

home
network
regional ISP

 RFC: Request for comments
 IETF: Internet Engineering Task
Force

institutional
network

Introduction 1-9

What’s the Internet: a service view


Infrastructure that provides
services to applications:
 Web, VoIP, email, games, ecommerce, social nets, …



provides programming
interface to apps

mobile network
global ISP

home
network
regional ISP

 hooks that allow sending
and receiving app programs
to “connect” to Internet
 provides service options,
analogous to postal service
institutional
network
Introduction 1-10

What’s a protocol?
human protocols:

network protocols:








“what’s the time?”
“I have a question”
introductions

… specific msgs sent
… specific actions taken
when msgs received, or
other events



machines rather than
humans
all communication activity
in Internet governed by
protocols

protocols define format, order
of msgs sent and received
among network entities,
and actions taken on msg
transmission, receipt
Introduction 1-11

What’s a protocol?
a human protocol and a computer network protocol:
Hi

TCP connection
request

Hi

TCP connection
response
