Multiprotocol label switching (MPLS)


initial goal: high-speed IP forwarding using fixed
length label (instead of IP address)
 fast lookup using fixed length identifier (rather than
shortest prefix matching)
 borrowing ideas from Virtual Circuit (VC) approach
 but IP datagram still keeps IP address!

MPLS capable routers



a.k.a. label-switched router
forward packets to outgoing interface based only on
label value (don’t inspect IP address)
 MPLS forwarding table distinct from IP forwarding tables



flexibility: MPLS forwarding decisions can differ from
those of IP
 use destination and source addresses to route flows to
same destination differently (traffic engineering)
 re-route flows quickly if link fails: pre-computed backup
paths (useful for VoIP)



modify OSPF, IS-IS link-state flooding protocols to
carry info used by MPLS routing,
 e.g., link bandwidth, amount of “reserved” link bandwidth

up MPLS forwarding at downstream routers



10’s to 100’s of thousands of hosts, often closely
coupled, in close proximity:
 e-business (e.g. Amazon)
 content-servers (e.g., YouTube, Akamai, Apple, Microsoft)
 search engines, data mining (e.g., Google)



challenges:
 multiple applications, each
serving massive numbers of
clients
 managing/balancing load,
avoiding processing,
networking, data bottlenecks
