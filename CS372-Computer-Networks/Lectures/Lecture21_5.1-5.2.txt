Link layer: introduction
terminology:





hosts and routers: nodes
communication channels that
connect adjacent nodes along
communication path: links
 wired links
 wireless links
 LANs
layer-2 packet: frame,
encapsulates datagram

global ISP

data-link layer has responsibility of
transferring datagram from one node
to physically adjacent node over a link
Link Layer

5-4

Link layer: context





no more planning of routes
at this layer!
datagram transferred by
different link protocols over
different links:
 e.g., Ethernet on first link,
frame relay on
intermediate links, 802.11
on last link
each link protocol provides
different services
 e.g., may or may not
provide reliable data
transfer over link

transportation analogy:









trip from Corvallis to Washington
State Convention Center (WSCC):
 car: Corvallis to Seattle Westin.
 walk: Seattle Westin to
monorail station.
 train: monorail station to
WSCC.

tourist = datagram
transport segment =
communication link
transportation mode = link
layer protocol
travel agent = routing
algorithm (at different layer)
Link Layer

Link layer services


framing, link access:
 encapsulate datagram into frame, adding header, trailer
 channel access if shared medium
 Media Access Control (MAC) addresses used in frame
headers to identify source and destination
• different from IP address!



reliable delivery between adjacent nodes

 we learned how to do this already (chapter 3)!
 seldom used on low bit-error link (fiber, some twisted
pair)
 wireless links: high error rates
• Q: why both link-level and end-end reliability?

Link Layer

Link layer services (more)


flow control:
 pacing between adjacent sending and receiving nodes



error detection:
 errors caused by signal attenuation, noise.
 receiver detects presence of errors:
• signals sender for retransmission or drops frame



error correction:
 receiver identifies and corrects bit error(s) without resorting to
retransmission



half-duplex and full-duplex
 with half duplex, nodes at both ends of link can transmit, but not
at same time
 with full duplex, both can transmit at the same time

Where is the link layer implemented?






in each and every host
link layer implemented in
“adaptor” (aka network
interface card NIC) or on a
chip
 Ethernet card, 802.11
card; Ethernet chipset
 implements link, physical
layer
attaches into host’s system
buses
combination of hardware,
software, firmware

frame


sending side:
 encapsulates datagram in
frame
 adds error checking bits,
manages, reliable data
transfer (rdt), flow
control, etc.



receiving side
 looks for errors, rdt,
flow control, etc
 extracts datagram, passes
to upper layer at
receiving side

Link Layer 5-10

Error detection
EDC = Error Detection and Correction bits (redundancy)
D
= Data protected by error checking, may include header fields
• Error detection not 100% reliable!
• protocol may miss some errors, but rarely
• larger EDC field yields better detection and correction

otherwise

Link Layer 5-11

Parity checking theory
single bit parity:






detects single bit
errors.
The parity bit is 1 if the
number of 1s is odd.
The parity bit is 0 if the
number of 1s is even.

two-dimensional bit parity:
detect and correct single bit errors
 requires grouping transmissions into blocks


Change that 0 to a 1!

Link Layer 5-12

Internet checksum (review)
goal: detect “errors” (e.g., flipped bits) in transmitted packet
(note: used at transport layer only)

sender:






treat segment contents
as sequence of 16-bit
integers
checksum: addition (1’s
complement sum) of
segment contents
sender puts checksum
value into UDP
checksum field

receiver:
 compute checksum of
received segment
 check if computed
checksum equals checksum
field value:
 NO - error detected
 YES - no error detected.
But maybe errors
nonetheless?

Link Layer 5-13

Cyclic redundancy check






more powerful error-detection coding
view d data bits as a binary number D
choose bit pattern (called a “generator”) of r+1 bits as
binary number G
sender: choose r CRC bits as a binary number R such that
entire binary number DR exactly divisible (using XOR) by G
receiver divides DR by G (using XOR): If non-zero
remainder: error detected!
 can detect all burst errors less than r+1 bits



widely used in practice (Ethernet, 802.11 WiFi, ATM)
D (d bits long)

R (r bits long)

G (r+1 bits long)
