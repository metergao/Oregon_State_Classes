Chapter 3: Transport Layer
our goals:


understand
principles behind
transport layer
services:
 multiplexing,
demultiplexing
 reliable data transfer
 flow control
 congestion control



learn about Internet
transport layer protocols:
 UDP: connectionless
transport
 TCP: connection-oriented
reliable transport
 TCP congestion control

Transport Layer 3-1

3.7 TCP congestion control

Transport Layer 3-2

Transport services and protocols






provide logical communication
between app processes
running on different hosts
transport protocols run in
end systems
 send side: breaks app
messages into segments,
passes to network layer
 rcv side: reassembles
segments into messages,
passes to app layer
more than one transport
protocol available to apps
 Internet: TCP and UDP

Transport Layer 3-3

Transport vs. network layer
network layer: logical
communication
between hosts
 transport layer: logical
communication
between processes


 relies on, enhances,
network layer services
 key fact: each layer
knows how to access
and communicate with
the layers above and
below it!

Transport Layer 3-4

Transport vs. network layer
household analogy:
12 kids in Ann’s house sending letters to 12 kids in Bill’s
house:
 hosts = houses
 processes = kids
 app messages = letters in envelopes
 transport protocol = Ann and Bill who demux to
in-house siblings
 network-layer protocol = postal service

Transport Layer 3-5

Internet transport-layer protocols


reliable, in-order
delivery (TCP)
 congestion control
 flow control
 connection setup



unreliable, unordered
delivery: UDP
 no-frills extension of
“best-effort” IP
