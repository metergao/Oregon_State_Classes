all datagrams leaving local
network have same single
source NAT IP address:
138.76.29.7,different source
port numbers

datagrams with source or
destination in this network
have 10.0.0/24 address for
source, destination (as usual)
Network Layer 4-1

NAT: network address translation
motivation: local network uses just one IP address as far
as outside world is concerned:
 range of addresses not needed from ISP: just one
IP address for all devices
 can change addresses of devices in local network
without notifying outside world
 can change ISP without changing addresses of
devices in local network
 devices inside local net not explicitly addressable,
visible by outside world (a security plus)

Network Layer 4-2

NAT: network address translation
implementation: NAT router must:
 outgoing datagrams: replace (source IP address, port #) of
every outgoing datagram to (NAT IP address, new port #)
. . . remote clients/servers will respond using (NAT IP
address, new port #) as destination addr
 remember (in NAT translation table) every (source IP address,
port #) to (NAT IP address, new port #) translation pair
 incoming datagrams: replace (NAT IP address, new port #) in
dest fields of every incoming datagram with corresponding
(source IP address, port #) stored in NAT table

Network Layer 4-4

NAT: network address translation




16-bit port-number field:
 60,000 simultaneous connections with a single
LAN-side address!
NAT is controversial:
 routers should only process up to layer 3 (not
layer 4, network, where TCP ports are defined)
 violates end-to-end argument
• NAT possibility must be taken into account by app
designers, e.g., P2P applications

 address shortage should instead be solved by IPv6
Network Layer 4-5

NAT traversal problem


client wants to connect to
server with address 10.0.0.1
 server address 10.0.0.1 local to
LAN (client can’t use it as
destination addr)
 only one externally visible NATed
address: 138.76.29.7



solution1: statically configure
NAT to forward incoming
connection requests at given
port to server at given port

10.0.0.1

client

10.0.0.4

138.76.29.7

NAT
router

 e.g., (123.76.29.7, port 2500)
always forwarded to 10.0.0.1 port
25000
 Use different ports for different
services
Network Layer 4-6

NAT traversal problem


solution 2: Universal Plug and Play
(UPnP) Internet Gateway Device
(IGD) Protocol. Allows NATed
host to:
 learn public IP address
(138.76.29.7)
 add/remove port mappings
(with lease times)

 relay bridges packets between to connections

Traceroute and ICMP


source sends series of
UDP segments to dest
 first set has TTL =1
 second set has TTL=2, etc.
 unlikely port number



when nth set of datagrams
arrives to nth router:
 router discards datagrams
 and sends source ICMP
messages (type 11, code 0)
 ICMP messages includes
name of router & IP address

3 probes



when ICMP messages
arrives, source records
RTTs

stopping criteria:
 UDP segment eventually
arrives at destination host
 destination returns ICMP
“port unreachable”
message (type 3, code 3)
 source stops

IPv6: motivation




initial motivation: 32-bit address space is completely
allocated.
additional motivation:
 header format helps speed processing/forwarding
 header changes to facilitate QoS

Network Layer 4-12

IPv6: motivation


IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses
 2128 > 232
 3.4 * 1038 > 4.2 * 109
 This is 50 octillion addresses for each of 6.5 billion
people on earth

50 octillion addys*:
50,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000

IPv6: datagram format
IPv6 datagram format:
 fixed-length 40 byte header
 no fragmentation allowed

Network Layer 4-14

IPv6 datagram format
priority: identify priority among datagrams in flow
flow Label: identify datagrams in same “flow.”
(concept of“flow” not well defined).
next header: identify upper layer protocol for data (i.e. TCP)

Other changes from IPv4





checksum: removed entirely to reduce processing
time at each hop
options: allowed, but outside of header, indicated
by “Next Header” field
ICMPv6: new version of ICMP
 additional message types, e.g. “Packet Too Big”
 multicast group management functions

Network Layer 4-16

Transition from IPv4 to IPv6




not all routers can be upgraded simultaneously
 no “flag days”
 how will network operate with mixed IPv4 and
IPv6 routers?

IPv6: adoption


US National Institutes of Standards estimate [2013]:
 ~3% of industry IP routers
 ~11% of US gov’t routers



Long (long!) time for deployment, use
 20 years and counting!
 think of application-level changes in last 20 years: WWW,
Facebook, …
 Why?
