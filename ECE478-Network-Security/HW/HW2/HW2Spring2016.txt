Homework 2  
(Assigned 4/28/16, Due 5/10/16 in class) 

Requirements: HW will be completed by each student individually (no collaboration). 
  
Directly  borrowing  (e.g.,  copy-paste)  from  any  material  and  putting  in  solutions  (e.g, 
from  online  solutions, Wikipedia,  or  research  papers)  is  plagiarism  (see  Syllabus  for  its 
corresponding  actions).  Please  cite  very  carefully  each  resource  you  use,  but  citing  a 
solution does not give a license to directly put it as an answer.  All of your answers must 
be in your in own words and interpretations. 

HW should be prepared by LaTeX or Word. Handwritten submissions are not accepted.

1)

[24] Merkle Hash Tree  

Suppose a sender S uses this Merkle hash tree to authenticate these messages to a 
receiver R. What should be done before this tree can be used?  

 

[8] How would one authenticate message 4?  

 
 

 
 
 

[8] Merkle hash trees have an additional level of hash in the leaves. Is this   
necessary? Why? 

[8] What are the necessary conditions for a set of data to be authenticated by  
Merkle-tree? Please provide at least two example application where Merkle-tree  
with proper data type can be used.  

2)  [24] Cryptographic hash functions and their use in one-time/multiple time 
signatures 
 
 
 
[12] Let L be the number of messages, t is the number of bits to be signed in a  
message, and |f| is the bit-length of one-way function. Describe Lamport One time 
 
signature variant I, II, III, IV, VI, and VII (excluding V) . For each variant,  
 
 
describe the its algorithm, its performance in terms of security and efficiency,  and 
what are the key sizes and what is its storage complexity. For example, for one  
 
variant, you might want to mention what is the computational complexity for the  
 
efficiency  of the algorithm and what is the security trade-off you must pay in  
 
 
order to achieve that efficiency. You must also mention what is the storage   
complexity of the public and private key in Big O.  
 

[12] One-time/multiple signatures, after many years, started gain a new traction  
  
in  the  research  community.  What  is  the  main  reason  behind  this?  Compared 
traditional cryptographic methods  (e.g., RSA, ECDSA), what  is  the main security 
advantage of multiple-time signatures and why they are more secure?  

3) [48] RSA encryption and digital signatures  

[8]  What  is  the  role  of  Euler-Function,  Extended  Euclid  Algorithm  and  Fermat 
Little  Theorem  in  RSA  encryption?  Explain  the  role  of  each  by  showing  the 
specific step in RSA encryption and decryption process.  

[8] Using Euclid’s algorithm (Not extended, but just Euclid), calculate the g 
  
gcd(16261,  85652).  Using  Fermat’s  little  theorem,  compute  3^31  (mod  7)  (Hint: 
Decompose the exponent) 

[8]  In  RSA,  public  key  e  can  be  smaller  than  the  private  key  d.  What  are  the 
performance  and  security  implications  of  this?  What  should  be  considered  for 
selecting public exponent e as a security metric?  

[8]  In  RSA  encryption  and  signatures,  the  use  of  private/public  key  pair  between 
sender  and  verifier  is  swapped.  Why  this  is  the  case?  (Hint:  Think  about  the 
purpose  of  signatures  and  encryption.  Also,  think  about  the  purpose  of 
authentication and its difference from encryption)  

[8]  In  RSA  signatures,  randomness  was  introduced  during  the  signing  process 
using  Coron’s  Full  Domain  Hash  Function.  What  is  the  objective  of  this 
randomness? Please again use Google Scholar to look up JS Coron’s paper on full 
domain hash  function. You may want  to  look Bellare’s paper on  full domain hash 
function.  Please  note  that  full  domain  hash  function  IS  NOT  an  RSA-based 
signature scheme.  

[8]  Textbook  implementation  of  RSA    is  subjected  to  timing-based  side-channel 
attacks. Explain why  (Hint:  see how  square  and multiply  algorithm works  and  tie 
this  to  a  side-channel  attack).  Describe  a  simple  blinding  technique  that  can 
prevent this basic side-channel attack. This technique is also called masking.   
 
 
4) [24] ORAM 
 
 
 
[6] What is the basic formal security definition of ORAM? Please go on Google  
Scholar and find the Path-ORAM paper by Emil Stefanov et al.  
 
 
 
[4] What is IND-CPA encryption? Give its formal definition based on symmetric  
 
encryption.   
 
 
 
[4] Why IND-CPA encryption is required in order for ORAM to work? 
 
 
 
 
[10] Give a basic Path ORAM tree with 8 items, where b1,…,b8 represent blocks  
to be accessed (assume stash size = 4). Denote each intermediate node with a  
 
number (see ORAM slides for an example). On this Path ORAM tree, why is  
 
accessing the same block arbitrary number of times yield indistinguishable access  
 
 
patterns? How is this achieved?  
o Why IND-CPA encryption plays a role on this? 
o Which  step  of  Path-ORAM  ORAM  algorithm  (in  addition  to  IND-CPA 
aspect) is vital to achieve indistinguishable access patterns?
