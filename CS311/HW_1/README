Assignment 1

Describe at least 2 ways of transferring files from a remote server to a local machine.
What are revision control systems? Why are they useful? Explain how to create a subversion or git repository on os-class (and create it, while you're at it).
What is the difference between redirecting and piping? Describe each.
What is make, and how is it useful?
Describe, in detail, the syntax of a make file.
Give a find command that will run the file command on every regular file (not directories!) within the current filesystem subtree.
The Sieve of Eratosthenes identifies all prime numbers up to a given number n as follows:

Write down the numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., n. We will eliminate composites by marking them. Initially all numbers are unmarked.
Mark the number 1 as special (it is neither prime nor composite).
Set k=1. Until k exceeds or equals the square root of n do:
Find the first number in the list greater than k that has not been identified as composite. (The very first number so found is 2.) Call it m. Mark the numbers
2m, 3m, 4m, ...
as composite. (Thus in the first run we mark all even numbers greater than 2. In the second run we mark all multiples of 3 greater than 3.)

m is a prime number. Put it on your list.
Set k=m and repeat.
Put the remaining unmarked numbers in the sequence on your list of prime numbers.
Write a C function which returns the number of primes less than a given value, as well as the values of all the primes. It might be worth writing this in a way that can be easily used later...

You will be implementing the following items in python, as a single python script with multiple functions. You must have a main function. There should be a way to select between them:
Write a python script that creates the following directories for a given term and course:
assignments
examples
exams
lecture_notes
submissions
Also create a symbolic link to /usr/local/classes/eecs/<term>/<class>/public_html called 'website', and a link to /usr/local/classes/eecs/<term>/<class>/handin called 'handin'.

It is your responsibility to ensure that you don't attempt to create a directory that already exists. Make use of the os, sys, and getopt modules, with both short and long form options for term and course.

Find the greatest product of five consecutive digits in the 1000-digit number.

                                                                           Bonus points if you can do it in a function of fewer than 3 lines.
                                                                                    Using names.txt, a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score. For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in
                                                                                    the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714. What is the total of all the name scores in the file? See the posted examples for how to work with a file. For this, A = 1, B = 2, etc.
                                                                                    The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, tn = $ n (n+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:
                                                                                    1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...
                                                                                    By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t10. If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word. Using words.txt, a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, how many are triangle words?
                                                                           Recreate this document in LaTeX. Things you may or may not find useful:
                                                                                    the align environment
                                                                                    the fleqn option to your document class
                                                                                    the nabla symbol
                                                                                    left and right commands
                                                                                    the partial command
                                                                                    the mathrm and mathbf commands
                                                                                    The Comprehensive LaTeX Symbol List
                                                                                    the amsmath documentation
                                                                            
It should look identical to the supplied file. You will need this file as well. Since you should be compiling this document on os-class, I highly recommend you use a tool like curl or wget to obtain this file.
