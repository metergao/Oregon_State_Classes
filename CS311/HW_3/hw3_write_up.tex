\section*{Design}

\subsection*{Uniqify.c Program}
Will sort words imputed though standard input or from a text file. This program will then print the sorted word
in alphabetical order with no duplicates via standard output or to a text file.

\begin{itemize} 
\item if no options/arguments, print usage
\item -n is the number of sort processes to use, if not defined the default is 2
\item -i the text file to read unsorted words from, if not defined standard input is default
\item -o the text file to create or append with sorted words if not defined standard output is default
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Functions of Program Details}

\subsubsection*{-n Option}
The number of sort processes to spawn. This number is limited to 1000 processes by default. With that said high number
of processes exceeding > 500 tend to fail. If user inputs more than more than > 1000 it will print the usage of the
program. The number of processes defined is not the absolute number of processes spawned by this program. The
program spawns a process for the suppressor as well.
\begin{itemize}
\item if there is a number received then spawn that many processes, if no input then 2 is default.
\item NOT RECOMMENDED to use more than 500 processes, but max number is 1000.
\item if more than 1000 is revived print usage
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection*{-i     Option}       
The input file, this file must be in the current directory of the executable. This file must be a text file that
can be read by POSIX read() command. If no input file is designated in the command line Words will be received via
standard input. To close the standard input dialogue you must press Ctrl-D a few times. 
\begin{itemize}
\item if there is a file open it, if not send error.
\item if no file name is received open standard input.
\item Close standard input with Ctrl-D
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{-o     Option}
The file in which the sorted words will be saved too. This function will print every word received from input on
line apart in alphabetical order excluding any duplicates. The output function will print the words "Your sorted
words are" art the beginning and then list the words sorted. If this file has not been created then this function
will create the file received giving permissions 0666.If the file does exist then it will append the contents
already in the file. If no output file is received then standard output will be
used printing the sorted word to the terminal.
\begin{itemize}
\item if a file name is received then create it and print the sorted word to it.
\item if not print to standard output
\end{itemize}

\section*{Challenges Overcame}
This program was very difficult for me conceptually. It was like my first time using pointers I was very confused
at first and dint quite understand them but hackishly made things work. That is kind of how I felt with pipes and
forking this assignment. It was quite hard to keep track of all of the file descriptors and at first. Another
challenge I faced was managing where each end of the pipes are and which need to be closed and opened that was
hard for me conceptually but after a few scribbles on a piece of paper I got my pipes and processes in running
order.. 
\section*{Questions}

\textbf{What do you think the main point of this assignment is?}\\
I think the main point of this assignment is to make us familiar with pipes and managing separate processes.
Pipes are used very often in the industry and are a very important concept to learn. I also believe that a point
of these assignments are to challenge us all and make us better programmers .
    
\textbf{How did you ensure your solution was correct?}\\
I verified my code by using a text file with no duplicate words. I would at first see how many words were in the
file with the command "cat input.txt | wc -w" this pipes the input file into a word counting utility and displays
how many words are in the file. Since i used no duplicate words I ran a my function with the same functionality
with the | wc -w command and it printed a list of all the words  and the same number exported from cat. I also
tested it with many other process numbers and different input file sizes. 
    
\textbf{What did you learn?}\\
I learned how to use Fork(), Pipes(), and Exec() this was the first time I have ever used any of these functions
and it was very interesting learning there functions and the workings. It was more difficult conceptually to
complete this assignment than it was to code.
